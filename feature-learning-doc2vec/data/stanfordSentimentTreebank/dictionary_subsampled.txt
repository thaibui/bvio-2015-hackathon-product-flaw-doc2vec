, the French-produced '' Read My Lips '' is a movie that understands characters must come first .|43710
, the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own .|180955
, the benchmark against which all other Best Picture contenders should be measured|13641
, the characters in Swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .|180959

, the eye candy here lacks considerable brio .|142473
, the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation .|142474
, the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .|180965
, the film 's more determined to become the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre . But what about the countless other people who 'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?|142475
, the film 's shortcomings start to shine through|142477
, the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss .|62270
, the film does pack some serious suspense .|62271
, the film ends with a large human tragedy .|221576
, the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong .|23904
, the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .|180971
, the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability|180973
, the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .|180974
, the film is deadly dull|180976
, the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way .|180978
, the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .|142480
, the film is packed with information and impressions .|43719
, the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature .|102883
, the film never recovers from the clumsy clich√© of the ugly American abroad , and the too-frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability .|221583
, the film of '' The Kid Stays in the Picture '' would be an abridged edition|180980
, the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion .|62281
, the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .|180982
, the film suffices|23909
, the film trails off into inconsequentiality .|142491
, the first half of Gangster No .|62287
, the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens|180984
, the humor wry and sprightly|62290
, the ingredients are there .|221588
, the joke wears thin|142498
, the jokes are a little lukewarm ,|142499
, the journey does n't really go anywhere .|62291
, the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost Dadaist proportions .|221590
, the movie 's not .|180991
, the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .|180997
, the movie is hindered by a central plot that 's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about .|62300
, the movie is rather choppy .|102898
, the movie is remarkably dull with only Caine making much of an impression .|102899
, the movie looks genuinely pretty .|221595
, the new film is a subzero version of Monsters , Inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture .|221598
, the new script by the returning David S. Goyer is much sillier .|221599
, the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors ' workshop that it is .|102903
, the picture making becalmed .|142519
, the play behind the thing|23917
, the power of this movie is undeniable .|43723
, the recording sessions are intriguing , and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers .|62309
, the script carries Arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the `` other side of the story . ''|221605
, the seesawing of the general 's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy .|102907
, the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious|142526
, the startling optimism ,|23920
, the story is just too slim|142530
, the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery|181027
, the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes .|102912
, the writing is indifferent , and Jordan Brady 's direction is prosaic .|181029
, their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .|221613
, then becomes Bring it On ,|181032
, then becomes Bring it On , then becomes unwatchable|181033
, then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively|23923
, then you so crazy !|221619
, there 's little to love about this English trifle .|142541
, there 's nothing here you have n't seen before .|142545
, there 's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .|142546
, there 's something creepy about this movie .|102923
, they 'll probably run out screaming .|181048
, they 're presented with a wry dark humor .|23925
, they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill|142552
, they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an Asian landscape painting .|43741
, they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria .|23927
, they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .|181052
, they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four - minute egg .|142553
, think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity .|181055
, this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness .|102940
, this clever idea is far less funny than the original , Killers From Space .|142557
, this could be the worst thing Soderbergh has ever done .|142560
, this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition .|102942
, this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all .|62334
, this film 's heart is even more embracing than Monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .|62335
, this film 's impressive performances and adept direction are n't likely to leave a lasting impression .|181059
, this fourth animated movie in four years wo n't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open .|221635
, this has to be among the rare ones|142564
, this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .|142565
, this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why .|43746
, this is a watchable movie that 's not quite the memorable experience it might have been .|43748
, this is grand-scale moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture .|62345
, this is one adapted - from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen .|62347
, this is recommended only for those under 20 years of age ... and then only as a very mild rental .|102949
, this is that sort of thing all over again|102950
, this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine .|62350
, this is the most visually unappealing|181063
, this is the most visually unappealing .|221640
, this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994 , except that it looks even better .|43750

, this is your ticket .|13660
, this makes for perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children 's entertainment . You 'll forget about it by Monday , though , and if they 're old enough to have developed some taste|43752
, this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the Yiddish theater , both in America and Israel .|62353
, this might be apt|142570
, this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their \*\*\* off for an hour-and-a-half .|221643
, this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate .|62355
, this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror .|13661
, this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears , starring Ben Affleck , seem downright Hitchcockian .|221644
, this must have been a difficult shoot|142573
, this opera is n't a favorite|142577
, this overheated melodrama plays like a student film .|102957
, this sad-sack waste of a movie is a City of ruins .|221648
, this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by Allen 's astringent wit .|43757
, thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy .|62361
, those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy|23944
, those rejected must have been astronomically bad|181073
, though , is the film 's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters ' emotional wounds .|18488
, though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more .|221652

Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola 's inadequate performance|145787

It 's a long way from Orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry ( 1984 ) to the empty stud knockabout of Equilibrium|185023
It 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix 's .|185028
It 's a masterpiece .|185029
It 's a movie -- and an album -- you wo n't want to miss|40982
It 's a movie -- and an album -- you wo n't want to miss .|18987
It 's a movie that ends with Truckzilla , for cryin ' out loud . If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will .|185031
It 's a much more emotional journey than what Shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and|45715
It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .|185032
It 's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests .|25733
It 's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .|66489
It 's a pity that ( Nelson 's ) achievement does n't match his ambition|106813
It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .|185033
It 's a scathing portrayal|45720
It 's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it 's brilliant .|45725
It 's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects .|106816
It 's a slow slog to get there|18988
It 's a sly wink to The Others without becoming a postmodern joke|18990
It 's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture|66499
It 's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn . Nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining .|66504
It 's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but .|66506
It 's a sometimes interesting remake that does n't compare to the brilliant original .|146425
It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish .|224135
It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch|106818
It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise .|106819
It 's a strange film , one that was hard for me to warm up to .|66508
It 's a terrific American sports movie and|40983
It 's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .|185038
It 's a treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score|224137
It 's a treat watching Shaw , a British stage icon , melting under the heat of Phocion 's attentions .|66511
It 's a very tasteful rock and roll movie .|106821
It 's a visual Rorschach test|146433
It 's a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told , with superb performances throughout .|66513
It 's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .|146434
It 's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that 's actually sort of amazing .|66516
It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick|185045
It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .|185050
It 's all pretty tame .|106829
It 's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage .|66521
It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness .|185054
It 's also clear from the start that The Transporter is running purely on adrenaline ,|146439
It 's also clear from the start that The Transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film 's shortcomings start to shine through|146441
It 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .|106831
It 's also stupider|146444
It 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long .|106833
It 's an ambitious film|66523
It 's an ambitious film , and as with all ambitious films , it has some problems . But|66525
It 's an effort to watch this movie ,|224157
It 's an effort to watch this movie , but|224158
It 's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it .|224160
It 's an entertaining movie ,|106837
It 's an interesting effort ( particularly for JFK conspiracy nuts ) , and Barry 's cold-fish act makes the experience worthwhile|66532
It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .|185058
It 's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing .|66534
It 's an old story|14160
It 's an old story ,|40985
It 's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother\/daughter pair .|66535
It 's another retelling of Alexandre Dumas ' classic .|224161
It 's another retelling of Alexandre Dumas ' classic . Why ? Who knows , but it works under the direction of Kevin Reynolds|66539
It 's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that 's often written off as indie film naturalism .|146448
It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .|185073
It 's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our Hollywood has all but lost .|45731
It 's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .|146464
It 's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes .|146466
It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .|106845
It 's crafty , energetic and smart|66546
It 's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate|106851
It 's definitely a step in the right direction .|106853
It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting|185098
It 's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script .|146473
It 's drab . It 's uninteresting . It squanders Chan 's uniqueness|106855
It 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational|146474
It 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and|146476
It 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it 's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff|146477
It 's dumb , but|146481
It 's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but Westbrook 's foundation and Dalrymple 's film earn their uplift|106862
It 's easy to love Robin Tunney -- she 's pretty and she can act -- but|106866
It 's endearing to hear Madame D . refer to her husband as ` Jackie ' --|40988
It 's endearing to hear Madame D. refer to her husband as ` Jackie ' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer .|224169
It 's everything you do n't go to the movies for .|146484
It 's exactly what you 'd expect .|185109
It 's far from a frothy piece ,|224170
It 's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones .|224173
It 's fascinating to see how Bettany and McDowell play off each other .|25748
It 's fun ,|40991
It 's fun , but a psychological mess , with Austin Powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet .|146487
It 's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty .|66554
It 's fun lite .|45733
It 's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot .|66556
It 's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once .|66557
It 's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that Hollywood is n't laughing with us , folks .|224177
It 's got all the familiar Bruckheimer elements ,|106877
It 's got all the familiar Bruckheimer elements , and Schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the Hopkins\/Rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas|106879
It 's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile|146492
It 's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and|66560
It 's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it did n't entirely grab me ,|66562
It 's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it did n't entirely grab me , but|66563
It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom ,|185113
It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and|185114
It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .|185116
It 's hard to imagine Alan Arkin being better than he is in this performance .|45736
It 's hard to imagine anybody ever being '' in the mood '' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as The Grey Zone ,|45738
It 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and Shiner , starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that|146501
It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .|224185
It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles|185122
It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but Notorious C.H.O. still feels like a promising work-in-progress|224186
It 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there Tolstoy groupies out there ? It 's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death|185127
It 's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .|146506
It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . And|185129
It 's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of Janice Beard ( Eileen Walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant .|146511
It 's just filler .|224192
It 's just plain boring .|185136
It 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and|185140
It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .|185143
It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .|185144
It 's like Rocky and Bullwinkle on Speed , but that 's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie 's strangeness .|106892
It 's like a `` Big Chill '' reunion of the Baader-Meinhof Gang|224196
It 's like a drive-by . You can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise .|185146
It 's like an old Warner Bros . costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie Errol Flynn always wanted to make , though Bette Davis , cast as Joan , would have killed him .|106898
It 's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend .|224202
It 's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you 'll likely think of this one .|224203
It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .|146538
It 's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity .|66581
It 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar American style of justice that plays out here , but it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .|106903
It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though|224205
It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though ,|224206
It 's mostly a pleasure to watch .|66585
It 's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be . But it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds|40994
It 's neither as sappy as Big Daddy nor as anarchic as Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy|185151
It 's neither as sappy as Big Daddy nor as anarchic as Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy , but it has its moments|185154
It 's never laugh-out-loud funny , but|106908
It 's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing .|106910
It 's nice to see Piscopo again after all these years , and Chaykin and Headly are priceless|106915
It 's not a bad premise , just a bad movie .|106917
It 's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie|66596
It 's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie ,|66597
It 's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but|66598
It 's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but|106920
It 's not a great monster movie . But|45745
It 's not a great monster movie . But if you 've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn , there 's guilty fun to be had here . Chomp chomp !|45747
It 's not a motion picture|66601
It 's not a particularly good film|185162
It 's not a particularly good film ,|185163
It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .|185166
It 's not exactly a gourmet meal but|40995
It 's not going to be everyone 's bag of popcorn|66602
It 's not horrible , just horribly mediocre .|146553
It 's not just a feel-good movie , it 's a feel movie . You feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off|66613
It 's not life-affirming -- its vulgar and mean|224214
It 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but|106930
It 's not only dull because we 've seen ( Eddie ) Murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed .|106933
It 's not particularly subtle ... However , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion|66625
It 's not really funny|185170
It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but|185174
It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors .|185176
It 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie .|224219
It 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . No , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so Children of the Century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else|146575
It 's not too racy and it 's not too offensive|224222
It 's obvious ( Je-Gyu is ) trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom|185185
It 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold|146586
It 's often infuriatingly glib and posturing|25757
It 's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and|40998
It 's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer|40999
It 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient ,|146593
It 's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads .|224224
It 's petty thievery|106940
It 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .|146602
It 's plotless , shapeless|66633
It 's plotless , shapeless -- and|66635
It 's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless . Indeed ,|66639
It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel ,|185188
It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but|185189
It 's predictable ,|41000
It 's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but Bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period|66645
It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...|106942
It 's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits .|224233
It 's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who ca n't come up with legitimate funny , and it 's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed|146606
It 's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain|18997
It 's rare to find a film to which the adjective ` gentle ' applies , but the word perfectly describes Pauline & Paulette .|106947
It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy|185203
It 's refreshing to see a romance this smart .|66651
It 's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .|106952
It 's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink|146620
It 's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon .|106953
It 's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way .|45756
It 's still Adam Sandler , and it 's not Little Nicky|224243
It 's still terrible !|224245
It 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .|185214
It 's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series .|66670
It 's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful .|106961
It 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .|146621
It 's sweet .|224247
It 's sweet . It 's funny . It wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy Hawaiian shirt . And ,|106964
It 's sweet ... but|185223
It 's sweet ... but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end .|185225
It 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes Sex With Strangers , which opens today in the New York metropolitan area , so distasteful .|106968
It 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it|146626
It 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name .|185230
It 's the perfect kind of film to see when you do n't want to use your brain .|224255
It 's the sweet Cinderella story that '' Pretty Woman '' wanted to be .|66677
It 's the type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least .|66683
It 's the type of stunt the Academy loves :|106971
It 's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of Sarah and Harrison .|106974
It 's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives Secret Life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self .|14166
It 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .|146631
It 's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor .|224264
It 's tough , astringent , darkly funny and ...|146633
It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .|185234
It 's tough to watch , but|45762
It 's tough to watch , but it 's a fantastic movie .|45764
It 's traditional moviemaking all the way ,|41009
It 's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible .|66684
It 's unlikely we 'll see a better thriller this year .|106978
It 's up to ( Watts ) to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe .|66689
It 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them|45766
It 's very Beavis and Butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle .|66690
It 's witty and inventive , too|25768
It 's worth taking the kids to .|106980
It ai n't art , by a long shot|66693
It all adds up to good fun .|25773
It all starts to smack of a Hallmark Hall of Fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television .|185241
It all unfolds predictably|185242
It becomes gimmicky instead of compelling|146642
It becomes gimmicky instead of compelling . ''|146644
It ca n't escape its past , and|224271
It can be safely recommended as a video\/DVD babysitter .|106985
It can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .|224274
It certainly wo n't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time|106988
It cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you .|224276
It dares to be a little different|25774
It depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept .|66701
It does give you a peek .|224278
It does n't believe in itself ,|146654
It does n't do the original any particular dishonor ,|146656
It does n't make for great cinema|106992
It does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes .|106997
It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .|185271
It does n't quite work ,|146668
It does n't reach them , but|224287
It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events|185272
It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .|224290
It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .|185273
It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .|185275
It establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly ,|66706
It extends the writings of Jean Genet and John Rechy , the films of Fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of Goya .|14170
It falls far short of poetry , but it 's not bad prose|224295
It finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .|107001
It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and|185279
It follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every Schwarzenegger film : Someone crosses Arnie . Arnie blows things up .|146685
It forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling|224300
It gets old quickly . Watch Barbershop again if you 're in need of a Cube fix|146686
It gets the details of its time frame right but|146691
It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions|146692
It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions .|146693
It gets under the skin of a man we only know as an evil , monstrous lunatic|66712
It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time|224304
It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .|185283
It has a subtle way of getting under your skin and sticking with you long after it 's over .|25780
It has its faults|45785
It has its faults , but|45787
It has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing .|45790
It has the ability to offend and put off everyone|45791
It has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but|45793
It has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion . It risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise .|25784
It has the right approach and the right opening premise|185289
It has the right approach and the right opening premise , but|185291
It haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away|224314
It haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away .|224315
It haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . Ah yes|45798
It haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . Ah yes , and then|45801
It haunts you|224316
It helps that Lil Bow Wow|14171
It is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie|224322
It is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made Eurotrash cult object . It is also , at times , curiously moving .|146699
It is a film that will have people walking out halfway through|25786
It is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film .|66729
It is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some . I have n't seen one in so long , no wonder I did n't recognize it at first|41018
It is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see .|224329
It is about irrational , unexplainable life|45806
It is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band .|45807
It is amusing , and|45811
It is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual|66734
It is definitely worth seeing .|45814
It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .|185296
It is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this .|107013
It is intensely personal and yet -- unlike Quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times .|14173
It is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style .|146702
It is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad .|107014
It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ;|146704
It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .|146706

The abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture ca n't quite conceal that there 's nothing resembling a spine here|187906
The acting|26750
The acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production 's austere locales .|26753

The film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience . It has fun being grown up .|26826
The film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from Paul 's perspective .|47089
The film sparkles with the the wisdom and humor of its subjects .|47090
The film truly does rescue ( the Funk Brothers ) from Motown 's shadows .|109844
The film was n't preachy , but|109850
The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) .|188216
The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama ,|109855
The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , '|109856

The first five minutes|69608
The first hour|188235
The first mistake|188237
The fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on B√ºttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history|69616
The following things are not at all entertaining|188241
The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching Seinfeld ( who is also one of the film 's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy|188243
The footage of the rappers at play and the prison interview with Suge Knight|109866
The fourth `` Pokemon ''|226292
The fourth `` Pokemon '' is a diverting -- if predictable -- adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world 's delicate ecological balance .|226293
The fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch Jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad .|69620
The furious coherence|149451
The furious coherence that ( DeNiro ) brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .|149453
The ga-zillionth|149454
The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .|188253
The good is very , very good ... The rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful|188257
The good thing -- the only good thing -- about Extreme Ops|188261

The heightened symmetry of this new\/old Cinema Paradiso|26835
The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized ,|188266

The holiday message of the 37-minute Santa vs. the Snowman leaves a lot to be desired .|226306
The hot topics|47114
The hot topics of the plot are relegated to the background -- a welcome step forward from the Sally Jesse Raphael atmosphere of films like Philadelphia and American Beauty .|47116
The humor and humanity|47117
The humor and humanity of Monsoon Wedding are in perfect balance .|47119
The humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .|149461

The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie|109903
The inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers|26838
The inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time .|26842
The inspirational screenplay by Mike Rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end .|47125
The intent is almost exactly the same ( as The Full Monty ) . All that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .|149486
The irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own|188290
The isolated moments|109908
The jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center .|47127

The journey to the secret 's eventual discovery|69654
The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ;|188298
The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .|188302
The kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you|41271

The kooky yet shadowy vision Clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive .|19313
The lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome|149503

The last 20 minutes|149509
The last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming ,|149511
The last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others ' affections .|188307
The latest installment in the Pokemon canon , Pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace .|149522
The leads|69669
The leads we are given here|188315
The leaping story line , shaped by director Peter Kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions ,|47139

The mantra behind the project|188332
The mark|47145
The material and the production itself are little more than routine .|188342
The members manage to pronounce KOK exactly as you think they might , thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible . It 's very Beavis and Butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle .|69691

The movie 's vision|188402
The movie , despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places , is wry and engrossing .|69729
The movie , directed by Mick Jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .|149568
The movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable|188407
The movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as ... ( Quills ) did by showing them|226353
The movie addresses a hungry need for PG-rated , nonthreatening family movies|26860
The movie addresses a hungry need for PG-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it does n't go too much further|41275
The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .|188413
The movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .|149573
The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .|149574
The movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies|188418
The movie has a script ( by Paul Pender ) made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions|149588
The movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate\/surf culture , the L.A. beach scene and the imaginative ( and sometimes illegal ) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults .|226359

The movie is n't just hilarious|26869
The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced '|188437
The movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it .|69747

The movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it 's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . A touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back|47183
The movie plays up the cartoon 's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength .|69759
The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . I tried to read the time on my watch .|149618
The movie sticks much closer to Hornby 's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of High Fidelity did .|26875
The movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary|149620
The movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short .|149624
The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .|149625

The movie turns out to be ( Assayas ' ) homage to the Gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .|188457
The movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , Rocky-like moments|69762
The movie worked for me right up to the final scene ,|110013
The movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and then it caved in|110015
The movie would seem less of a trifle if Ms . Sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine .|110017
The music|110018
The music makes a nice album , the food is enticing|110021
The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys .|149635

The origin story is well told|188505
The otherwise good-naturedness|69791
The otherwise good-naturedness of Mr . Deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less - than-likely New York celebrities ... certainly raises the film above anything Sandler 's been attached to before .|69800

You 'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . You 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .|151107
You 'll laugh at either the obviousness of it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness|71116
You 'll probably love it .|227266
You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the Zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .|189919
You 're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins . But|111326

You come away from his film overwhelmed , hopeful and , perhaps paradoxically , illuminated .|111346
You come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story .|189931
You could say that it 's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people would n't , but one thing you could n't say is that Alias Betty is predictable .|19444
You do n't need to know your Ice-T 's from your Cool-J 's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of California .|71140

You may be captivated , as I was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why Paul Thomas Anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which Adam Sandler will probably ever appear .|71147
You may feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject .|111352
You may leave the theater with more questions than answers , but darned if your toes wo n't still be tapping .|71148
You might not want to hang out with Samantha|27302
You might say Tykwer has done all that Heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-Kieslowski a pun as possible .|227299
You need n't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of Haynes ' work . Though Haynes ' style apes films from the period ... its message is not rooted in that decade .|111357

but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness|20164
but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going|29795

but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte|29800
but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment|20167
but certainly not without merit|195037

but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity|229512
but it 's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation .|29823
but it 's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances .|29824
but it 's easily his finest American film ... comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his Hong Kong films .|29825
but it does n't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions .|29831
but it has a lot in common with Piesiewicz 's and Kieslowski 's earlier work , films like The Double Life of Veronique .|15320

is its Tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret .|124168

it 's a bad , embarrassing movie|163601
it 's a beaut .|21083
it 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` the loud and the ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated|7842
it 's a brazenly misguided project|203720
it 's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy !|7848

it 's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it|1431
it 's all quite tasteful to look at|203739
it 's also a failure of storytelling|203741
it 's also drab and inert|203742

it 's good|21085
it 's good enough for our girls|124832
it 's hard not to be carried away|84898
it 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .|7866
it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .|232944
it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile|203760
it 's hard to stop watching|84904
it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .|232945

it 's just another sports drama\/character study . Yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . Plus , like I already mentioned ... it 's Robert Duvall ! C'mon !|84916
it 's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades|16316
it 's like dying and going to celluloid heaven|53752

it 's nowhere near as good as the original .|84929
it 's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental|7882
it 's over|33600
it 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .|7885
it 's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome|232965

it 's rare to find a film to which the adjective ` gentle ' applies , but the word perfectly describes pauline & paulette .|7893
it 's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from '' promising '' to '' interesting '' to '' familiar '' before landing squarely on '' stupid ''|1450
it 's realistic about all kinds of love|33605
it 's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards|7894
it 's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong|84941

it 's sort of bogus and it 's ho-hum all the way through|163691
it 's sort of true|163692

it 's tempting just to go with it for the ride|163699
it 's thanks to Huston 's revelatory performance .|84948
it 's that life stinks|163701
it 's the best sequel since The Empire Strikes Back ... a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth .|53765
it 's the delivery that matters here|124879
it 's the kind of motion picture that wo n't make much of a splash when it 's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards|7901
it 's the repetition of said behavior|163704

it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time .|21102
it faded from my memory|16336
it fails|203892
it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject|124968
it feels|203896
it feels a bit long|203897
it feels almost anachronistic|124972
it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema|124973
it feels like a glossy rehash .|203898
it feels like a suicide race|163794
it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and|7937
it feels more forced than usual .|124975
it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior|16338
it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior ,|16339
it flat|163795
it flirts with bathos and pathos and the further Oprahfication of the world as we know it|124980
it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be|53810
it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script|163796
it gets the job done|124984
it gets to you . Just like Igby .|124985
it great|21105
it grows up|124987
it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles|163803
it had just gone that one step further|233023
it has a lot in common with Piesiewicz 's and Kieslowski 's earlier work , films like The Double Life of Veronique .|16342
it has just enough spice to keep it interesting|33654
it has made its way into your very bloodstream|124990
it has no sense of humor ...|163811
it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults|85042
it has to prove anything|33656
it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us|163814
it held my interest from start to finish .|33658
it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich|163816
it holds up in an era in which computer-generated images are the norm|85045
it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .|233030
it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert|53815
it interested|203922
it intriguing , bizarre ,|53818
it irresistible|33662
it is|7945
it is a glorious failure .|53823
it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes Mr. Hill higher than he 's been in a while .|233035
it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie|53825
it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie ,|53826
it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie , and|53827
it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie , and Mandy Moore leaves a positive impression|53828
it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor|125001
it is a whole lot of fun|233036
it is a young artist 's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood|85056
it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings|125005
it is an interesting exercise by talented writer\/director Anderson|125009
it is and|203925
it is as seductive as it is haunting .|53830
it is as tedious as one|163822
it is clever , but it is never melodic|163828
it is clever , but it is never melodic \ \/|163829
it is derivative|53832
it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .|125012
it is disposable .|203928
it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world|21110
it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . Unfortunately|203931
it is flawed|85061
it is for Angelique|125015
it is formula filmmaking|85062
it is frequently amusing|125016
it is hard to care|203934
it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why|125018
it is interesting to witness the conflict from the Palestinian side|125022
it is just as boring and as obvious|203937
it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to Belushi 's easy-going likableness .|163835
it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show|163836
it is missing|85068
it is n't .|125024
it is n't downright silly|163838
it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly|163839
it is n't nearly as terrible as it cold have been|7952
it is n't that funny|163841
it is nature against progress . in fessenden 's horror trilogy|7953
it is nature against progress . in fessenden 's horror trilogy ,|7954
it is never melodic|163844
it is nevertheless compelling|53839
it is nevertheless maintained throughout|85071
it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that U.S. foreign policy has played in the rise of Castro .|233047
it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us|203947
it is spooky and subtly in love with myth|125034
it is supposed to be|203948
it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art|233050
it is thought-provoking .|233052
it is too cute by half|233054
it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of Ms. Ambrose|233055
it is what you think you see .|53841
it is with most of these things|163850
it is worth searching out .|125039
it just gets stupid and maudlin .|233057
it lacks focus|233059
it lacks grandeur|16348
it lacks in outright newness . Plus , like I already mentioned|85079
it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature|203955
it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences|163854
it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment .|233062
it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind|203959
it look as though they are having so much fun|233063
it looks even better|53844
it looks like Woo 's a P.O.W.|233064
it makes My Big Fat Greek Wedding look like an apartheid drama|163861
it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics|85088
it makes up for in compassion , as Corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action .|53846
it makes up for with a great , fiery passion .|85091
it marks him as one of the most interesting writer\/directors working today|125049
it marks him as one of the most interesting writer\/directors working today .|233068
it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces|203970
it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie|85099
it might have held my attention , but as it stands I|203975
it might more accurately be titled Mr. Chips off the Old Block|233072
it might work better . But|125056
it might work better . But it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness .|125058
it migraine-inducing|1484
it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche .|125059
it more if it had just gone that one step further .|203976
it must|53850
it must have seemed to Frida Kahlo as if her life did , too|125061
it needs to be|53851
it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it|125063
it never lacks in eye-popping visuals|85109
it offends by just being wishy-washy|163884
it offers|125065
it offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us|125066
it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds|33696
it often is|163886
it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant|53852
it or not|21121
it overstays its natural running time|233077
it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators|85115
it plainly has no business going|203990
it plays like a reading from Bartlett 's Familiar Quotations|125070
it portrays|163891
it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive|163892
it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony|233080
it promises , just not well enough to recommend it|204002
it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance|163894
it ranks with the best of Herzog 's works|53854
it rarely achieves its best|125080
it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza|204006
it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end|125083
it reveals|125085
it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway .|85121
it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment .|125088
it searches ( vainly , I think ) for something fresh to say|125093
it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama|204008
it seem|125094
it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little .|163903
it seems to be on auto-pilot|163904
it serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool .|85126
it should be most in the mind of the killer|125099
it should deliver a moral punch|163910
it should have been|163912
it solemnly advances a daringly preposterous thesis|85131
it somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart|53862
it something|33710
it something any true film addict will want to check|33711
it sounds sick and twisted|1487
it sounds sick and twisted ,|1488
it stands I|204019
it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of ` hypertime '|204020
it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story .|53864
it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion|85134
it still seems endless .|233095
it still works|125106
it straight|163922
it stuck to Betty Fisher and left out the other stories|53867
it suffers from too much Norma Rae and not enough Pretty Woman|204027
it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion|125110
it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance|204031
it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going|125111
it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .|163929
it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited|204035
it throws you for a loop .|53870
it thumbs down|204036
it to the max|33723
it to their own kids|33724
it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious|163933
it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink|163937
it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness|163940
it up . Wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it|163941
it up to my adoration for both De Niro and Murphy|21129
it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree|125125
it was an honest effort and|204056
it was geared more to grownups|33728
it was n't Shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but Pinocchio .|233100
it was so weak , and|163955
it went in front of the camera|233104
it were less densely plotted|204077
it were that grand a failure|233106
it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by Julia Roberts|204081
it will just as likely make you weep , and|53882
it will lessen it|204082
it will never hold a candle to the original|163961
it will remind them that Hong Kong action cinema is still alive and kicking .|125144
it will warm your heart , and I 'm giving it a strong thumbs up|125148
it wins you over|33732
it with Ring|125149
it won -- and wins still|85163
it would be a page-turner|16362
it would be better to wait for the video .|233108
it would be better to wait for the video . And a very rainy day|204090
it would be called Beta Alpha Delta .|163965
it would be in another film|85168
it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all|233113
it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo .|233114

that 's a bad sign .|236351
that 's a big part of why we go to the movies|37728
that 's all|236356
that 's already a joke in the United States .|213470
that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny|134139
that 's apparently just what ( Aniston ) has always needed to grow into a movie career|94471
that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs .|134144
that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue|213474
that 's been given the drive of a narrative and that 's been acted out|236363
that 's been told by countless filmmakers|213475

that , by the end of Monsoon Wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater|37746
that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything|134173

that freely mingles French , Japanese and Hollywood cultures .|213636
that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation|134329
that gets even better in hindsight , as you mull over its every nuance in your mind|37803
that gives|173013
that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name|213639
that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . The movie|213642
that goes into becoming a world-class fencer|134334
that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly|213643
that grows in power in retrospect|22179

that has preceded it|94682

that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen|11068
that have become a Spielberg trademark|57797
that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries|213657
that have marked an emerging Indian American cinema|134346
that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media|213658

that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit|213660
that he 's shooting the latest System of a Down video|173026
that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure|134350

that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance|213668
that his film is molto superficiale|213670
that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense|22181
that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by Brendan Fraser .|236451
that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle|173035
that human nature is pretty much the same all over|134360
that if the filmmakers just follow the books , they ca n't go wrong|11073
that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic '|213672

that is actually funny with the material|134374
that is controlled by neither character|37824
that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom|37827
that is generally|134380
that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance|11079
that is impenetrable and dull|213680
that is n't just offensive|134385
that is n't nearly as graphic but much more powerful , brutally shocking and difficult to watch|94721
that is n't trying simply to out-shock , out-outrage or out-depress its potential audience ! Who knew|94722
that is nearly perfect in its relentless descent to the depths of one man|37832
that is only mildly diverting|213683

that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film|11082
that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit|236465
that is worthy of our respect|134394
that it 's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste .|134400
that it 's also one of the smartest|134401
that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times|236470
that it 's based on true events|57815
that it 's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler|11086

that it ends by blowing just about everything up|173076
that it ends up|236479
that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own|213718
that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my Thanksgiving to-do list|213720
that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger|173079
that it is|134425
that it is n't very good|173084
that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand|213723
that it lacks focus|236481
that it makes your least favorite James Bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as The Usual Suspects|173090
that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems|57821
that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy|213725
that it might more accurately be titled Mr. Chips off the Old Block|236482
that it not only invites|37840
that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling|37841
that it ranks with the best of Herzog 's works|57823
that it seems the film should instead be called ` My Husband Is Travis Bickle '|94743

that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant|134440
that its own action is n't very effective|213738
that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker 's son , more incredible|37843

that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming|94751
that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic|94753

that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse|213745
that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending|134444
that leaks suspension of disbelief|134446

that life 's|94760
that life 's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced .|94762
that life stinks|173113
that linger like snapshots of memory|11097
that little room|134450
that long-held illusions are indeed reality ,|42778
that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work|213750
that made it all work|213752
that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes|173116
that made the original Men in Black such a pleasure|94766
that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture|94767
that make 105 minutes seem twice as long|134459
that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm|94769
that make you|134463

that moral favorite|94789
that most every aggrieved father clich√© has been unturned|236501
that most frightening|134477
that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad|134480
that movie|134481
that much different from many a Hollywood romance . What sets it apart is the vision that Taymor , the avant garde director of Broadway 's The Lion King and the film Titus , brings|57853
that never becomes claustrophobic|134485
that never catches fire|173140
that never materializes|173142
that no wise men will be following after it|213785
that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe|173148
that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original|236505
that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times|236509
that of John|173152
that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought|236511
that offers food for|94797

that omnibus tradition called marriage|57857
that one enjoys a bad slasher|173155
that one man 's ruin may be another 's fortune|37871
that one never overwhelms the other|11107
that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we|213796
that only sex , scandal , and a chorus line of dangerous damsels can deliver|37872
that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at|94801
that open-minded Elvis fans|94802
that parade about as if they were coming back from Stock Character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination|134506
that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies|94806
that peace is possible .|94807
that peaked about three years ago|134507
that perfectly illustrates the picture 's moral schizophrenia|173159
that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way|213801
that perverse element of the Kafkaesque where identity , overnight , is robbed and replaced with a persecuted `` other|236518
that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective|94816
that plays like a 95-minute commercial for NBA properties|134513
that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part|57862
that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but|134517
that praises female self-sacrifice|213807
that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after|57864
that produced this project ...|173165
that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen|213810
that pushes a majority-oriented director like Steven Spielberg to follow A . I . with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority|57868
that pushes a majority-oriented director like Steven Spielberg to follow A.I. with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority|236523
that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers|94826
that puts the sting back into the con|94827
that quickly snowballs out of control , while focusing on the what much more than the why|57869
that rapidly deteriorating line|22193
that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness|134526
that rare creature --|94830
that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners , and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep|94831
that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday|57870
that rare family movie --|94833
that rarity|134527
that real natural , even-flowing tone|134529
that really scores|213813
that really tells the tale|94841
that recreates a place and time that will never happen again|57875
that refuses to develop an energy level|173173
that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations|57876
that relies on personal relationships|213815
that resonate with profundity|11114
that revels in the true potential of the medium .|37883
that revives the free-wheeling noir spirit of old French cinema|134541
that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama|213820
that saves his pathos from drippiness|37886
that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good|213822
that screams '' bathroom break|22199
that seems compelling and even original|37890
that seems to have no goal and no urgency|236528
that seems to include every top-notch British actor who did not appear in Gosford Park ( as well as one , Ms . Mirren , who did )|94853
that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes|134549
that sends you out of the theater feeling|94854
that sentiment|213823
that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd|94857
that shading|37891
that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans|213827
that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing|94859
that should have been the ultimate IMAX trip|213831
that should please history fans|94861
that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety|94863
that shows just enough to keep us on our toes|57882
that simply feel wrong|213834
that ski mask|173195
that slather Clearasil over the blemishes of youth|57884
that snake-down-the-throat business|173197
that so many talented people could participate in such an|213836
that so often end up on cinema screens|57886
that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill|94865
that soars above the material realm|134563
that some people|213839
that somehow it hit you where you live|22200
that something has been lost in the translation to the screen|173199
that something inexplicably strange once happened in Point Pleasant|173200
that sort of thing|11120
that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot .|94873
that sport|94874
that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness|11121
that still leaves shockwaves|94877
that still lingers in the souls of these characters|134570
that storytelling is what the movies are about|173204
that strays past the two and a half mark|94879
that stretches the running time about 10 minutes|236538
that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time|213849
that substitute for acting|173207
that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the Godzilla sized soda|37900
that suffers because of its many excesses|173209
that takes Mr. Hill higher than he 's been in a while|236542
that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women|213858
that takes its sweet time building to a climax that 's scarcely a surprise by the time|134572
that takes nearly three hours to unspool|57889
that takes place during Spring Break|213860
that takes time to enjoy|94888
that taymor , the avant garde director of broadway 's the lion king and the film titus , brings|11128
that team|11129

that tends to hammer home every one of its points|173215
that the German film industry can not make a delightful comedy centering on food|236549
that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now|213867
that the answer is as conventional as can be|213869

that the film never feels derivative|94900
that the franchise 's best years are long past|213876
that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one|173227
that the human story is pushed to one side|236555
that the likely audience will already be among the faithful|37906
that the material is so second-rate .|213881
that the most positive comment we can make is that Rob Schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl|134585
that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story|213885
that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that Carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it|213888
that the only possible complaint you could have about Spirited Away is that there is no rest period , no timeout|134587
that the picture is unfamiliar ,|57899

the film conjures the magic of author J.K. Rowling 's books|236883

the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough|173900
the film does n't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously|11386
the film does n't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia .|11390
the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .|236889
the film ends with a large human tragedy . Alas , getting there is not even half the interest .|214587
the film equivalent|135322
the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book|135323

the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .|173902

the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in .|38220
the film for you|214593
the film from the very beginning|38221
the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters|58306
the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic .|135324
the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much|214599
the film has a lot of charm .|135325
the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks|135329
the film in a coma|11391

the film never feels derivative|95673
the film never recovers from the clumsy clich√© of the ugly American abroad|236900
the film of `` The Kid Stays in the Picture ''|236905
the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrates and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours|214622
the film portrays|38227
the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . Or else a doggie winks .|214623
the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties|135362
the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion .|95676
the film should be seen as a conversation starter . It 's not an easy one to review .|214626
the film sometimes flags ... but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk , amusing pace .|11411
the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work|95683
the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) ...|173931
