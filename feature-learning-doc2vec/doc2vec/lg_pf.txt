I have always loved Sam Cooke's voice and looked long & hard at which CD to buy of his music. I settled on this one and couldn't be more pleased. Not only did it have all the songs I knew and loved but more that I have come to love in a very short time. As someone who also enjoys some gospel music I was happy to see gospel selections from when he was with the Soul Stirrers. Jesus Gave Me Water is one of my new favorites from this CD.I'm sure there are people whose taste is different and won't enjoy all the songs on here but I found it to be an excellent value.

This little swing put my colicky baby to sleep and the value of that can't be measured! It is small and portable, which was great for our small apartment. Other swings had very large bases which would have taken up too much room in our small living space. This swing doesn't have a lot of frills, but does the job!

It does not allow one to browse folders and select the pictures to view. This means there is no way you can show the picture you want to show. Instead, it just displays every picture in a circular manner.

I purchased it and within 30 minutes I returned it. I shot a few videos in the car and parking lot to see the quality. The image quality was pretty decent, but the sound was alright. In fact, the main reason why I returned it was because the camcorder makes this spinning noise that gets recorded onto the video. In quiet situations, it may be a problem. But if you're out and about, it should be okay.I never tried the still photo, but in general you shouldn't use a camcorder to take still images.

After a lot of research, including sets 4 times more expensive that would come fully installed, we decided on this set. All the perks we wanted and great price. We read all the helpful, detailed reviews and took notes so to follow their directions. After presorting and labeling, etc. It took 2 people 24 hours over a span of a few days to complete. We did small parts at night in the garage first, but did the crux of the work over a weekend. And we are handy, do it yourself people. So that was the only pain. I think you do have to factor in that it was very hot outside too, so that plays a bit of a role.Our only complaint regarding installation was that the directions can be very vague at times or the picture will show something, but the words say something else. Or two diagrams of the same task will be different.Our girls are out there daily with neighbors, and it seems sturdy and they love it! Definitely worth more than the price, but the time put in... that was a pain.

This tank set is nice & comes with almost everything you need to get started but I have issues with the filter. It's not very powerful & the only place you can get replacement ""cartridges"" is at WalMart!So if your local store happens to be out, you're out of luck. They don't sell them online either, which makes no sense.Guess I'd better stock up if I see some but I'm already shopping for a different filter.

I ordered this dresser and the crib when our now 2 year old was born. It is beautiful, and the crib has held up great. But one year into using the dresser the bottom drawer fell apart. I was only using it as a sock drawer, so I didn't over weigh it. The front panel literally spliced around the pegs that were used to hold the drawer together. The other two drawers held up great, and I continued to use the dresser by just leaving the bottom area open, but you should be aware that you do pay for what you get. We are now expecting our second boy (third child) and I am debating buying this again with the understanding that it may not last, and the expectation that I will buy him a more expensive suit when he gets to be a big boy. We will continue using the crib.

I have had this swing since my 3 year old was born. I received it as a shower gift. She lived in the swing until she was a little over a year old. Now my three month old LOVES it too. The only issue I have had is that the motor died recently. Fisher Price does have a replacement one available for only $36 plus $4 shipping, which is very reasonable and I will be replacing the motor. It does have a one-year warrenty and Fisher Price has excellent customer service!

This treadmill is ok for smaller people, but i would not recommend it to someone looking to lose a substantial amount of weight. I am heavy although well under the weight limit and it feels like i am having to pull the belt when I am walking on it. It is not a smooth walk like at a gym. The fan is also of poor quality and it blows above my head (i am 5'6) It was generally easy to put together and i assembled it by myself within about an hour and a half. All together I feel like I could have got the same quality with one of the cheaper treadmills.

Worth every penny. Charge doesn't last as long as it should so always keep you 12-volt charger in the glove for standby but otherwise an excellent product. Finds everything near by from restaurants to the bank that you bank at. Easy to store frequent destinations and current location. Only wish that it had a keyboard style setup and not ABC to Z like an elementary school chart. Make sure you purchase the friction mount which costs about $40 b/c the winshield mount is guaranteed to fall of while you're driving.

Other than getting it a day later than expected, my overall opinion about this product is that it's worth the wait. First of all it was bigger than I expected, secondly it has volume control (no more loud commercials), and lastly it was real easy to put the stand on it. The only down side is that I only get channel ""3"", and that's due to my antenna not picking up any digital channels, but it's all good I have direct tv anyway, so I really don't need the digital channels.

I was looking for a nice table for my room and once I saw this one, I thought that it would be a nice alternative to a wooden table. It looks sleek and modern and could also be used as a ottoman.I am very happy with the way it looks, and it only took a couple of minutes to screw the legs in.I use it as a table and sometimes I put it at the end of my bed and it looks even better there.The quality is obviously not as good as a real leather table, but it's not too bad for the price.I have to mention that when you sit on the table or push your hand against it, it does distort the leather a little bit, but I have noticed that it goes back to its original shape after a while.

I love the crib tent. Our son is 20 months old decided he would just let himself out of his crib one morning. The sound of him hitting the floor scared me to death. He loves his crib tent, and loves that he gets to have his bumpers back as well. It gives me piece of mind. Until it was delivered I was nervous to take a shower every morning, that I might not make it to his room before he decided to try and get out. Wal-Mart had the best price out of everywhere I checked online, and you can get Upromise money for shopping at Wal-Mart online. Best part, my shipping was free also, with Site-to-Store. We are extremely please and would recommend to anybody with a child. I don't know about durability since we have only had it about a month.

I do like this dryer. I have a small apartment with no dryer hookups. This compact dryer fits right where I need it to go. Since it uses 110v, I can plug it right into my wall outlet. The only thing I don't like about it, is that it takes about a hour and twenty minutes to dry a load of clothes. It's a small price to pay considering how much I am saving by not going to the laundry mat.Since this dryer requires external venting, I had to purchase a indoor lint catcher with hose (hose not included with dryer). The problem with the lint catcher is that there is no lint to catch. The dryer's dual lint screen catches EVERYTHING. Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase.

We needed a narrow bookcase, and this fit perfectly in our space. The cutout on the back side at the bottom is the perfect height to allow the bookcase to sit flush against the wall, going around the base boards.Many other websites charge almost as much for shipping a product like this as they do for the actual product, so this was a good deal overall.

I saw this griddle and thought it would be an inexpensive decent griddle to use occasionally. My wife told me to go with Lodge and I didn't think it would be worth it considering how infrequently I would use it. I saw one review about how hard it was to take the ""protective"" waxy layer off, but saw all the other good reviews and thought it would be worth a try. What a mistake, and the I told you so's never stopped. The griddle itself is ok, a bit rough but I thought with a little seasoning it would work out. The waxy layer however is the worst thing ever. I don't know who had the bright idea to add this layer in manufacturing should be fired. It is impossible to ever get completely off. It's stuck in every nook and cranny of the griddle. The directions to remove it were followed and totally ineffective. I tried everything to remove it, but it never does. On this basis alone it fails. The rest of it is ok for the price, but you will definitely pay for it in wax smoke inhalation, waxy tasting foods, and nothing but frustration. In the end I should have listened to my wife and got the Lodge. Doh!!!

If you move the transmitter 5 feet away from the radio it gets too fuzzy to hear, and sometimes, especially in the car, it's impossible to even find a working station. The batteries never last long, either. All in all, this product was not worth the money

As mentioned in other reviews; blacks are pretty dark. Colors are good. Resolution is good for price and size. Stereo works but speakers are small and hollow sounding. But has stereo out for better speakers. Has auto lighter plug and ac/dc power unit. RCA output cord for from dvd player(stereo). A nice stand and stick antenna. Regular coax cable input. (Be careful when adjusting the whip antenna supplied because possible to break input.) All in all for the price it's fine. Not super picture but this is portable camping/kids-in-car TV. Great for 89 bucks. I have it hooked to roof antenna 25 miles from city and it picked up all avaliable stations first time. whip..not so good but picked up a couple. Buy it.

I bought this camera thinking it would be great for taking pictures of my children and the sports that they are in. It takes great pictures and is everything I wanted except that you have to always look through the eye piece to take a picture. You CAN""T use the LCD screen to see the object you are shooting. I didn't like that. If I am spending that kind of money I expect to see the picture I'm taking on the LCD screen. Overall I would give it 4 stars if you don't mind looking into the eye piece everytime.

One thing I liked about it was that it didn't irritate my eyes. I've used eye creams in the past that were so irritating that my eyes would continue to water until I washed it off. This didn't do that. It also seemed to remove the slight dry/tightness on my eyelids that I felt after washing my face. That being said, it didn't do much for the lines that develop at the outside of your eyes from squinting or laughing or whatever. It only seemed to work on the very tiniest of lines. The ones that you would have to get really close to see. The ones that are clearly visible, it did nothing for. I won't be renewing this little jar. At $15 for .5oz, it wasn't worth it for me.

I love this protein drink, it is very good, and the taste is the best in protein shake have had since I began drinking protein shakes. When you compare it to a GNC brand this shake comes out 100% better and the price is so much more reasonable. I find that it helps me control my eating and does exactly what is supposed to do. I would definitely recommend this shake over any other shakes. The taste is great, it is not ice cream so don’t except an ice cream taste. If you want more power and a better feeling after exercising, go out and get this shake, you won’t be disappointed.

I oredered this file cabinet to go with the desk and bookcase. They are all very beautiful, sturdy and functional. I have no complaints on any of the other pieces, in fact I ordered another bookcase, tv stand and end tables but, when I tried to put my hanging file folders in, the drawer wouldn't shut because there's not enough room between the tabs on the hanging file folders and the inside top of the cabinet.I tried to find smaller tabs but had no luck. I did find some self adhesive index tabs that I'll try to stick on the hanging file folders so I can get the drawer to shut without ripping the tabs off.

This camcorder came and I have not had a chance to play with it much, but, it does seem to work good. I have used to still camera function. That works ok. I expect the camcorder aspect will work well too. I like that it comes on when you flip open the lcd screen. It does seem to be a good, but cheaply made, unit. So I wouldn't advise handling it roughly at all. But, if you're a low budget person like myself, give it a try. For the price, you can't lose.

I've had this product for about 4.5years and it works great. I still have the original batteries. It is constructed well and is very accurate. It's simple to use once you get use too the interface. Just be sure you use it before you go work out or your results will be messed up. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is serious about monitoring their body fat either for weight loss, Maintaining proper body fat for runners, triathletes or bodybuilders. I use it monthly to make sure I'm STEADILY losing body-fat and while building muscle. I chart it on my notebook. Remember when one loses body-fat steadily( .5 - 1lb a week averaged over quarter) it is much better and more stable then losing a bunch of weight in a short period of time. Your body will think that it is always at the perfect weight and not think that it is starving.

This is an excellent game. I got it and couldn't put it down. It took about 40 hours of game time to get 100% completion and all of the achievements, and there's sure to be downloadable content.It's beautiful in 1080p, and it has a massive open world to explore, including Florence, Tuscany, Venice, a small part of Rome, and your own family's villa. Leonardo da Vinci creates new weapons for you as you progress, like the flying machine featured on the back cover.The main quest is a blend of 1480s corruption and an underground battle with the Knights Templar that branches into modern day conspiracy theories and even the birth of mankind. If you haven't played the first, however, you'll be a tad confused by the storyline, so make sure you pick that up and play through the main quest first.I can't wait for number 3.

Great value for the money! Had a few ""user error"" issues. Locked myself out of Windows 7 (hey, it happens) and it was a doozie trying to get back in. The fact that Windows 7 came pre-installed on the EMachine and did not come with a Windows 7 disc crippled the troubleshooting. Had to use my desktop for research and eventually called my ""computer guy"" to get me back in. LSS - MAKE SURE YOU SAVE YOUR PASSWORD TO A FLASH DRIVE OR EQUIV. ASAP (or disable the 'login' type feature altogether)! OTHER THAN THAT...I am really satisfied with it. Meets my needs and didn't hurt my pockets! :)

With so many nice light clear storage bins on the market these were the wrong way to go for me. They are heavy, so if you fill them they are hard to lift for an older person or person with limited mobility. I think they'd be good for garage storage as they are thick and sturdy. They have an odd narrow shape that tapers down and wastes space. I had a nook I wanted to fill with Christmas storage with these. I could only fit 6 because of the odd shape. But with the clear square lighter bins I could fit 10.

This camera is great - the combination of auto and manual one would expect from an DSLR with the quality one expects from Canon. Don't forget the telephoto lens(es) though. The kit lens is fine for ""standard"" shots, but I've had the telephoto (Canon EF-S 55-250 IS Telephoto - available in a Walmart bundle with the camera) on the camera much more than that one.Love it, and absolutely recommend it.

Walmart did their part very well, the item shipped quickly and tracking information was provided. The time from unpacking to a fully assembled bike will take about an hour and may require 2 people. The instructions are very vague and they rely mostly on diagrams, for example; ""Attach seat to frame assembly"" with a sketch of a seat and a post - nothing more. If the instructions were better written it might take less time to assemble and give you more confidence that you did it correctly. After using the bike for approxmately 2 weeks, the right pedal fell off and I was unable to reattach it because the threads were mangled. I am not sure if I contributed to this during assembly of the bike. The instructions for attaching the pedals; ""attach pedals to frame assembly."" - they should have mentioned that there is reverse threading on one pedal and clearly diagramed the difference between a left and right pedal. I contacted the manufacturer and I did receive quick and courteous help and new parts were express shipped to me. The operation of the bike was otherwise fine and it is quiet too. I would also agree with others that said the bike may not be good for taller people. I am 5'9"" and with the seat adjusted all the way back, my knees still come pretty close to the handlebars when pedaling.

The primary problem is if you put anything on top of this thing the top drawer will not close properly and it makes it look bad. It is too easy for something in a lower drawer to catch the drawer above. The drawers are sized to hold a lot of stuff but the unit is not design to handle the weight of the stuff. It is very easy to break the plastic drawers and the base where the caster wheels connect. The problem here is if the base cracks where the wheel connects then the post for the caster wheel will not stay in and keeps coming out. The other wheels do not easily come out and make for an awkward situation with 3 wheels in and one out. I would not recommend this or any plastic Sterilite product with caster wheels for this reason alone. The Sterilite products are always a good deal but in the end you get what you pay for.

I bought this for my ""almost 7"" year old son for reading books and playing video games. It will be plenty big for him as well as my 4 year old. It was a lot bigger than I expected which was a plus since I was hesitant when others wrote they'd bought it for much younger kids. I had no problems with the filling. I read others felt theirs was deflated and needed more filling. Although it's good to know you can buy more filling, I will not be needing any. I'd buy it again and again, it's a perfect addition to his football themed room!

This is a DVD of Jeff's comedy special from Comedy Central and it is an exact reproduction, word bleeps and all. That was the only thing that I did not like about it. When I buy a DVD of a comedy special I have already seen on TV, I get it because I want to hear it without all the annoying bleeps on the ""bad words"". There was not the option to hear it without the bleeps, even though that option exists on his previous DVDs.

For the price this is a good buy. It is very easy to assemble, done in about 7 minutes. The only set back I noticed is that the bassinet portion is too thin and we had to invest in a portable crib mattress to cushion it which cost about $25. Although, I am still pregnant and haven't gotten to use the bassinet yet, but will post an update once she arrives.

Had the Vizio previously till the owner of the tv moved out and took it so I needed to get my own. I bought this one because the price was right. Picture quality was mediocre and the sound is awful. No matter how much I adjusted the sound with the equalizer, I could not get a quality sound. If you buy this tv, you will need to get a separate speaker system. You get what you pay for. I'm returning it and getting the Vizio.

I spent a few minutes trying to decide between the Cisco/Linksys AE 1000 and the NetGear RangeMax WNDA3100. They were the same price at WalMart and $10-$10 less than Best Buy (respectively.) I chose the Cisco because I had recently purchased a Cisco E 1000 router. The NetGear appears to have a slight edge in technology, but I decided to go with the same brand and I had read the NetGear uses a lot of CPU resources. This is purely for regular Internet use, no file sharing or big music or video downloads.The AE 1000 is a snap to install. The optional base has a 3' or so USB cord, allowing me to raise it up and away from the computer. I'm getting excellent signal from the router which is 12 feet away but in another room.I am a bit disappointed that while the router and adapter are rated as ""up to 300 mbps"" I'm only getting 144. If I go to a multi-media network or get into HD uses at home linking TV and computer Ill go for more horsepower. But this is working wonderfully for my needs.

Great book if you are interested in building a Baja Bug or offroad buggy, or for understanding better the one you have and how to fix it yourself. This book has been around for many years and could stand a revision, but the author has passed away. I proofread this 1987 edition of the book for the author before it was released. We were racing together in a buggy in Baja, Arizona, Nevada and the California Mojave desert at the time. I owned a business building, repairing and maintaining such cars and have won a championship racing them and have been Inspecting this type of race cars before the races since 1973. So I know about the subject. A great deal of this book is still relevant in spite of its age. To VW offroad enthusiasts, this book is pretty much their ""Bible"". It's well written and EZ to read. Excellent for someone who is new or has been around. I've recommended this book more times than I could possibly remember.

This product gets the job done if you simply want to train your pet to go onto a ""selected area."" The quality of the pad is quite low compared to the higher priced brands. For some reason, my dog attacks the pads and chews it up rather than using it for what it was intended for. The scent mechanism does attract the dog but my dog chews it up! I'd prefer the higher cost brands for it's quality. I thought any pad would do for my indoor pet but I was wrong. He seem to prefer the other brand. Talk about a spoiled pet!

I have one just like this. They're all made by the same Chinese company. I've used it for all kinds of things including hauling away cut-up logs, large stumps w/roots, even large piles of leaves. It's come in quite handy. The ONLY real problem - and it's a big one - is that it tips over VERY easily whether you're traversing a slight hill or hit a small bump while turning. Obviously, there's an easy design answer to this but, as with so much in life, the people who design tools like this don't use them. There are other very small modifications that would make this tool even more useful. I wish some AMERICAN company would take up the challenge, hire me to design it, and pay me royalties. Then they'd have a smash hit on their hands because they'd be filling a real need in the market that this product only provides a glimpse of.

This Acer Mini is not and should not be considered as a desk top replacement, nor should it be considered a viable laptop replacement.Instead, it is strictly a very small portable connection to the internet. This Mini Acer is perfectly designed for the person on the go, as it is small enough to fit in a purse or a briefcase. But because it is so small, it is difficult to navigate on the undersized keyboard and undersized mouse thumbpad, and especially tedious during usage over long periods of time.I will return the unit in favor of getting a conventional size laptop with a full function keyboard and a large thumb pad mouse.Again, this Mini is a perfect design for travelers who need frequent and convenient access to the internet, especially to receive text messages or to view reports or to visit websites. But to use it in a manner that would require entering data over long periods of time, forget it!

I've seen some reviews that really ran this safe down. All I can say is if you want a $4000.00 safe, put out that amount of money. Don't buy a lower lined safe then gripe cause it doesn't have the features of a top of the line product.

I purchased this item and it works pretty well, but I did have to install and uninstall and then install again two or three times. A little hassel in the beginning, but now it works fine. One thing I have noticed is that it works best as long as there's a clear line of site between the Dongle and the hub. Also the extent to which the two can be apart is about 12 feet and it does not work between walls. There has to be a clean line of site. It serves it's purpose for what I need because the dongle and the hub are never more than five feet apart and so it works fine. Hope this helps.-ADAM

There are a number of features with the reclining back, tilt seat, thick seat cushion, adjustable arm rests (up and out), adjustable back height and, of course, the seat height. It was really easy to assemble as well. I did have my doubts because of my weight but the chair is very sturdy. Overall I really like it.

I did a lot of research before buying this coffeemaker about 3 weeks ago. I was looking for something easy to use, which only makes a small amount at a time, keeps coffee warm without all the extraneous pieces, and inexpensive. I read many reviews, so I knew what to expect with this coffeemaker, including that I would need #4 filters, as it does not come with any nor state what size is needed in the instructions. I have been very pleased with this coffeemaker and had the added bonus of the coffee being hotter than most makers in the lower price range. I would definitely recommend this coffeemaker for households where only a small amount of coffee is needed to start the day.

You know what when you pay 59 $ you don't expect a 500 $ worth jewelry! This is not ruby it's created ruby. Get real! The pendant is BEAUTIFUL and it is even better than it should be for such a good deal. The chain is lightweight yep - as per advertised. Read the specs it's all in there. So you know what you get.

She is able to reduce 4 lbs in 2 weeks, without vigorous exercise. Only glitch I would note here is about setting the walking belt. It is very difficult to adjust it initiallly. The manual says that we need to tighten the screws as we want to align the belt. It shifts to either left or right, if it is left loose. It took a while for me to adjust it to align. Another point to be noted is about the slope of the walking platform. I think it is too much. I have to stack with a block at the back to make it straight and once it is made straight, it is pretty easy to walk. She enjoys walking on this treadmil

At first, it was tough to figure out what was going on. But when you started to get going, it wasn't so bad. The computer characters tend to screw you up alot and there's nothing you can do to get rid of them. It wouold be nice when you plug in ""one"" or ""two"" players, that you should only see those playing...not extra players run by the game.

This is a very well made item, the only problem is that is is made for large spools with a 1/2"" dia hold in the center. Most of the spools I purchase have a smaller dia center hole and do not work with this item.If you purchase large spools this is great, if not save your money for something else.

I purchased this gate over a month ago from Walmart.com and it is working out well. I have another baby gate that I paid over $70 dollars for and needed a second one for the kitchen. This gate was VERY easy to install. It took me longer to get it out of the box than to install. The handle is a little tricky at first since you have to squeeze the button and then push down on the handle but my son can't get it open :) It is worth the money and so far works well.

i upgraded from a model 200 and the 350 was worth the extra $$. i drive 20k per year thru the mountains for work, always to different places and the garmin is a terrific product and a great addition to a good map. i often leave it on the 'view map' function when i don't need directions.it comes with only very basic 'quick start' instructions, you have to either download the real manual or request it thru the website but there's no charge and prompt response to the request.

I love my baby bullet, I have been using it for about 2 months now. I got it as a gift from my father-in-law and I use it all the time. It is cute and very easy. I did however buy more storage cups for it, I did not order them from online, I actually bought the munchkin storage cups. They are silicone and have a screw on lid. I found that the 6 they give you are not enough once they start getting older and eating more. Plus I dropped on of the date dial cups while I was screwing on the lid to put it away and the lid cracked and broke. So I have 6 date dial cups and five lids. That doesn't work very well. So like I said I bought more storage cups. Now I would not spend the money on my own to buy it, but I do love it. It is a great gift, but other than coming with all the things to store it, you could do the same thing with the regular bullet or a regular blender.It is a great product and so simple to use, if you have the money and don't mind spending it, then go ahead and purchase one. Mine was a gift so I didn't spend the money but I do love it.

Very tasty & great for the calorie conscious but I've never encountered thicker, tougher pork casings in my life...and I've stuffed my own sausage! These are like inner tubes. The only way I could enjoy these was to peel off the casing. That's something I've never had to do before with other sausage in natural casings. It is for that reason alone that I would NOT recommend them. What a pity.

We love our new phones.It was so easy to set up. I had it done in minutes. Just plug them in. It didn't take long to charge up and use. I love the fact that you enter your directory numbers on one phone and they are in all 4 phones.My husband likes the intercom feature. He is handicapped and he can call me from the other end of the house. He likes having his own receiver at his chair. Much easier for him to call or answer when I am out of the house.

I got my moneys worth out of these desks.I have had my desks for over a year now and they are great.Easy to put together, it took me about 10 minutes to put the desk together.The only thing I do not like about them is the backing. It is uneven and does not stay on the back very well even if you lightly push something back on the shelf.

I did a lot of research before purchasing a mount for my daughters new flat screen. First of all you can't beat the price, my son in law is a contractor by trade so I had him mount it for me and it didn't take him long at all. Mounting was easy, instructions were pretty much to the point and easy to understand. Being a contractor he mounted it much differently then he should of so it holds even better for me but this was ment for a childs room and is serving it's purpose. If you are considering this it is not to be passed up. Even after opening the box it looks a lot nicer then a tv mount I purchased last year which was a lot more money.

My 3-year old son loves it - good for about an hour of entertainment before he gets restless to do something else, which is heaven itself. Great on pavement but also powerful enough to handle short grass and slight inclines easily. Bought it through WalMart's Site to Store, took it home to assemble (takes about an hour or so too) and noticed that the truck's dark grey body plastic had been damaged (white impact marks, probably occurred during shipping or manufacturing, too much trouble to return or exchange such a large item). But overall, great price for a sturdy, dependable, attractive ride-on toy that he'll probably be able to use for two or three years.

We purchased this product when my son was about 3 1/2 months old. He used it the first few weeks but we had to stay with him. When he turned four months old, he started grabbing the toys and turning the music on himself, and now he loves it!! It is a little awkward to adjust the height and angle of the caterpillar, but it is probably the best it can be for the flexibility the product offers.

This tv is great for the price, my only complaint is that the stand is shaky, tried to tighten and it still wobbles at the slightest touch, we have a 3 yr old niece and i am scared it will fall on her. we did not intend to get wall mount there is really no place we can decide on room is wierd shape. but i cant risk her safty, unfortuantely there are no more in stock to exchange. otherwise this tv is great, huge picture, football is great their heads are life size....superbowl will rock on this tv. we were going to purchase a soundbar, and they were out of stock on the one we really want so we are waiting. but it really does not need one. the volume on 6 is loud, level 9 is very loud and it goes much higher into the 20s. other than surround sound you really dont need a sound bar. but with a tv this big go all the way. going from a 32 to a 46 is hard to adjust, its too big... haha...ill get used to it.

The Action Replay is a very good item to allow you to either completely cheat on a game (good if you just want to play for the fun of it and not the challenge) or just to give you a small advantage (i.e. just a little bit of starting money in a rpg or that one pokemon you really like from the earlier generations). Regardless of your play style, you will enjoy having this product.Con: Do not buy it from a Wal-Mart brick and mortar store. They charge almost $10 more then online. If the 'Find in Store' button says you can get this same day on 'site-to-store' take advantage of the savings.

Of the three books I recently ordered from Walmart (The Time Traveler's Wife, The Lovely Bones, and My Sister's Keeper) this was by far the best.

We were very pleased with the chairs, we ordered six. We certainly feel we got a great deal. They are solid, and for the most part, level.We are shorter than most people so the foot rest is a little lower than we would like it to be. The support brackets are bright silver so they stand out (we could stain them I suppose). There were no ""guide holes"" as to where the screws should be placed on the seats.Other than those few comments we are really pleased.

We used this travel bag for our infant seat & its base. It was a little difficult for us to zip the bag around it but once it was closed, it didn't open during its transport. We were able to check it in with our other luggage and it held a pkg of diapers for us too. It did get a little beat up but overall, it held up great! We should be able to use it for a few more future trips. We think it will be more useful when we are able to use it with a forward facing car seat.

I am very disappointed in this product. I love to sing and play karaoke games, but this is NOT one of those games. The first problem is that the microphone is so low that you can't drown out the other people singing, and hence the next problem. You can't shut off the voices on the song, just lower them. Needless to say I am very disappointed from my Christmas present. I would not recommend this game at all, especially for the price that it is.

I just recieved this computer a few days ago. It was very easy to set up. I simply love the all in one design, having one cable instead of wires everywhere is awesome. It takes much less space and is neat and tidy. The touch screen is a big +. You will enjoy the feature more than you may think.Picture quality is good. Its a great computer for the price. I use it for streaming videos, surfing and email, the speed is good for my use.The only negative thing I have found is, you will need rechargable batteries and a charger, for the wireless keyboard and mouse. I had one for my camera already so I just keep 4 rechargable AA, 2 for use and 2 for backup when needed.I'm very happy with my purchase ! I'm just wondering what features I got for my last desktop for almost 2 G's, LOL. P.S. keep a rag handy for cleaning fingerprints off the touch screen :) ...

My husband and I used this mattress for a week long camping trip. We really liked it because we could each move around without waking the other one up (which is what usually happens when we share a queen size mattress). Also, during the day, we would fold the mattress over so it would serve as a couch in our tent, with floor space in the middle. It worked out really well. My only complaint is that we needed to add more air every other day or so, but I think this is pretty typical. Also note that it doesn't come with its own pump!

I shopped around for many months and kept my eyes on this tv because it seemed to offer good value for the price. I was wrong. I combed through every review that I could find online for this tv and came to the the realization that the sound on this tv would not be the best, I was okay with this.I decided that that would be a fair compromise to take less-than-great sound quality if all else was satisfactory. I am returning this set because the picture quality is HORRIBLE. On dark scenes (with lots of black) pixelation is painstakingly noticeable even to a non technical eye. At other times motion blur is SIGNIFICANT. RCA should consider discontinuing this tv. I made a trip to a Walmart store earlier this week and saw two of the same tvs being returned. It was somewhat comforting to know that others have probably had the same experience that I have had.I ended up not minding the sound quality as much as i had a problem with the picture quality. At times the picture was acceptable which made me think that perhaps i should diddle with the setting. When that didn't work, I upgraded my cable box to a HD one. After that failed, i tried using a HDMI cable to attach my cable box to the tv. My attempts at achieving better picture quality were in vain.

the product was great for our 16+ hour drive for vacation.The straps that hold the players up get in the way of the door opening and closing to change the video. It would of been more handy to have a side opening to insert and eject the movie.Screen quality was good and the fact that it is a dual screen worked out great for one forward facing and one rear facing child.Would recommend a longer cord to attach the screens though.

If Henry IV had electricity he would own this sound bar. In fact, he would put it in every room of his castle. Why?The answer is simple. Few products offer the elegance and ease of use of this Phillips. Easy to setup, wall mount, and it does a good job. This won't give you the satisfaction of a true surround sound system, but it beats the pants off the speakers that are built into your flat screen tv. Being able to control the base is nice, but this bar really shines because of its function as an HDMI hub-essential if you are connecting more than one device.

I reccommend this for anyone who can take gentle care of it. The screen is big and bright amd we downloaded lots of music, video clips and movies onto it. The case it came with was OK, it didn't have a screen protector incorporated into the case, (a plastic cover of some sort) It played great, sounded good and the functions were easy to use. The software was compatible on both my Vista and Windows XP machines. Easy convertor made it possible to watch all kinds of movies. The case really didn't work as a stand either.But reagardless... if the Zen isn't in some sort of full protective case, the screen will get scratched. I think the ad says somethning about scratch-resistant, but not so much ...TRUST ME! This thing is fragile.I was hoping it could take a little more abuse.This is how I found out...I bought this for my 13 year old son for Christmas.He opened it and it was loaded and ready to go so he checked it out for the rest of the day, but he thought the case was lame so he carried it in his pocket...baggy jeans and all...after the 2nd day he had it, the screen was scratched and there was a small crack on the bottom.Shock! but, no bigee, he orders a full plastic case to protect it..but he can't wait for the case to get here so he continues to carry it around in his pocket, without the case,.. then BAM!He proceeds to drop it, 1 time...and LCD sreen breaks at the top and now the screen barely works and it's not under warranty.$88 dollars to fix the screen +S&H.through creative...Wow, that was an expensive 2 weeks use. GONE! Just like that.The ironic thing is the extra case he ordered came in the mail today..if he would have just waited a little longer...I Just thought I'd share our experience with everyone.If it would have been mine I would still be loving it!

I have a 17 lb terror terrier that was a dog toy tester for Tuff Toys. My little terrier destroyed toys meant for pits, shepards, mastiffs ... the toughest of dog breeds. No toy lasted more than 45 mins. I only have 1 Kong toy left (red since most black Kong toys aren't made for smaller dogs) and he knows he will get a treat if he doesn't destroy it.This silly looking Monster Mouth I have now had for 4 days and it has been pure entertainment. I put small treats in it (I have the 3"") and he is obsessed with it. He doesn't seem to want to tear it apart, he is infatuated with getting the treats out of the mouth.He gets so very annoyed with it he picks it up and throws it around. It's comical to watch him toss it around then it flings out of his mouth, land and then he jumps on it and it starts all over again. He gets so annoyed he buries it in a throw blanket, then get mad at the blanket & justs goes nuts.I have read other reviews than say their dogs have chewed through or tore apart the plastic. Every dog is different. My dog destroyed 9 & 10 rating toys meant for large dogs & this one is still holding up. Four days is a big milestone for me since it was 45 mins prior to this.I will be purchasing some for my local animal shelter.

This doll house is much taller than my 5 year old and there is enough room for 2 kids to play at once, but it does get a bit crowded that way. It is fairly heavy up top, so make sure you mount it to the wall. The furniture that comes with it is very nice and sturdy and the house looks very well done. It is not cheaply made. My only complaint is that stickers that lable the parts for assembly do not come off easily and in one case ripped part of the wall paper off the side.

This product was a last option to repair my daughters HP laptop as HP was not going to patch a problem in their drivers for the wireless network adaptor. This product was a simple cost effective device that got my daughter's laptop back in action and performing as it should. i would highly recommend this product to anyone who runs into the same issue i did.

This was a requested gift from my kids (4), grandkids (10) and great-grandkids (7+). Seems everyone wants to make music - isn't that wonderful! Great family gift if they already have a Wii (and a Wii Board). Something they can do together and not very difficult to learn. Don't need musical training to use successfully.

For $104, you get a quality bed, table and chairs and toy shelf. I mean quality! It's not cheap plywood, it's sturdy and the pictures that are on the table, chairs and toy shelf are fantastically rich in detail and look like real photos! The bed is plastic and that did worry me at first, but once we put it together and my son laid on it, it held up great. The stickers/decals that you have to put on the bed are the best quality--no bubbles, no sticking problems and again they are nice pictures! The only ""problem"" we had was when we were putting together the toy shelf, we had to shave off a bit of one of the rungs to get them even to put together, but otherwise, it was quick and we were VERY surprised at the quality for the money--more bang for your buck!!!! So worth it!

This product does what it is suppose to do which is to keep my 11 month old daughter out my kitchen.She can beat on it and push with all her might and it do not fall or move. It was fairly easy to set up. The only bad thing I have to say about it is sometimes the handle is hard to pull up to open the gate. Other than that it's a great buy and would recommend it to any one.

It works pretty well. Finds satellites fast. Dead accurate placing the vehicle on the road your traveling. Quick recalculation response when you change course. Bright screen that can be seen even on a sunlit dashboard. Gives adequate notice for each turn or change in direction. My only gripe is the POI file and maps are out of date. For example, the nuvi did not know the location of my nearest Walmart even though the super store has been there for at least 5 years. Twice it directed me to fast food restaurants that did not exist: one was a vacant lot with weeds growing ten feet tall. The maps are not up to date either. In my subdivision, some streets which have been in existence for over two years are not on the nuvi maps. These streets are on Mapquest; why not on the nuvi? On a recent trip to Orlando, we needed to go to places where we've never been. The nuvi 200 flawlessly got us to our destinations, but not always in the most efficient way. All in all, I'd say the unit does quite well for the price, but only as good as the accuracy of the maps and POI database installed.

I did a lot of comparison shopping when looking for a bike light set. This one had the best features in its price range and Wal-mart had the best price. I had to do the ship-to-store purchase because none of the stores near me had this item in stock. I have been using it every night for over a week now and have been very happy. The combination of halogen and dual LED headlight was the main selling point for me and I am glad I decided on that feature. The only potential problem with this unit is that the tail light mounting bracket is very flimsy and must be handled delicately. The lights themselves are built well and can take a beating and the front bracket is not as flimsy as the rear. I highly recommend this unit for the money!

Had to replace all the speakers in my 13 year old BMW. (common problem is blown speakers in my model) So i replaced the speakers and the factory amp as well with the Sony 4-channel XM-GTX6040 also sold at walmart. I'm not one to go all out on a competition system or anything, i was just looking for a decent replacement. After wiring it all up i was first surprised at how much power the little amp put out and how the speakers seemed to like it. They punch REALLY hard and sound crystal clear! The highs are a bit over-powering, but i managed to get it to a good spot messing with the EQ on the head unit. These speakers don't have as much bass as i was expecting, like their frequency response is just too high. You can still feel a punch in your chest when they hit, but no sustained rumble what-so-ever. I HIGHLY recommend putting a sub in with these guys. They also mounted with no modification, the mounting holes are elongated to support a bunch of factory applications (thank god). I'm pleased with the results!

We previously had an 8 foot Intex pool for our 2 daughters and it was great. This year we decided to get one a bit bigger since the girls were bigger. This reminded me of the Intex pool and the price was ok so I bought it. We put it up and I am not happy with it. The main problem is the hose connectors leak like crazy. My husband redid them and made sure they were as tight as could they could get but still a constant drip, drip, drip. It seems at the rate they are both dripping we will be constantly refilling the pool all summer. Next year, (if this one even makes it through the summer) we will be buying a different pool and a different brand.

Brand name, color, and extra pieces are the only perks, which make this flimsy unit different from similarly low-quality dollar store items.There is no neat place to keep those extra pieces, and you supply your own batteries.It would be better to find an excellent pair of metal scissors, and pass them down.

I picked this up yesterday at my local Walmart for $75(clearance priced). It was worth the $159, but even a better deal now. It took about 30 minutes to unpack and check the pieces, and about an hour to put together. It was SO EASY. It is being used as an occasional table in the dining room and exactly matches a shelf we got at Pier One a few weeks ago. Looks great, solid and heavy. Top appears to be real wood. We didn't use the anti-tipping hookup.

The dresser is beautiful! I love the porcelain knobs, and the painted accents! It finished off our nursery perfectly! The only complaint I would have is that half way through assembly my husband realized that two of the drawer fronts were dented and the bottom decorative piece was completely broken in half. We had to wait for South Shore to send us replacement pieces. They had good customer service, for future reference, the easiest way to contact them is on their website. I had a hard time getting through on the phone lines, but had a reply from an email within a few hours.

I have had my Coleman electric lantern for more than six months. The on/off switch is hard to find in the dark. I consider this a serious design flaw in the category of an annoyance. The device should have been designed so that a person feeling it in the dark can easily find the switch. It may take only a little while longer to feel around for the switch but when you are in a hurry to turn it on it gets very annoying. Apart from this complaint the device performs satisfactorily.

I purchased it for a 10'X10' frame and it fit well. I would have like it better if it had a second zipper/door on the opposing wall also. It would have been better if it had more weight at the bottom to keep the breeze from blowing the netting in. All in all, it was ok for the frame I had (NOT a ""Weekender"") but I'll try something else next time for the same money I paid for this one or even pay a little more for something sturdier and more wind resistant.

I am very impressed with this rocker.I bought it for my daughter’s nursery and was a little worried at first about how much assembly it would take.I was expecting hard to follow instructions, a thousand bolts, and small pieces.However, when I opened the box I found that the base of the rocker and the accompanying ottoman were already built for me! All I had to do was attach the arms, the back, and then tie on the cushions to the rocker.I was done in 15 minuets. I would recommend this rocker and ottoman to anyone and everyone looking for a quick assembly and a comfortable chair.

I bough this laptop march 24th 2012. And exactly 2 weeks after it broke down on me! I'm very disappointed with Acer because they sent me a defective computer. It said bootable devices not found which means that the hard drive either got disconnected on its own or was loose and could not start my computer properly. I am a college student and need reliable computers because if not then I will fall behind. I had done two weeks worth of class work and home work and because I thought it Es a new computer therefore it wouldn't get messed up so quickly I decided to just leave my work there and not buy an external hard drive to back up my files. I Lost it all! I couldn't even get my information out because The hard drive was not showing up anywhere. I took it back for a full refund. Now I am going to save money to buy a Mac.

This guide is great for brand new players to the game. About 90% of the book is dedicated to begginer players. However, there is very little new content for level 80-85 players. Other than a few maps, and a lack-luster crafting section. While it can be argued that ""Cataclysm"" primarily changed most of the 1-60 content, and therefore the guide should focus on that. I still feel it was a complete waste of money for anyone already familliar with the game. Instead they should have put out a new begginers guide, as a companion book, and focused more on 80-85 content. Allowing people to spend their money on information actualy relevant to them.Bottom Line: Save your money and look it up on-line instead.

The DVD was superior to the televised version as it hadn't been edited and the picture quality was better.

Wonderful movie that can be appreciated by children and adults.

I basically wanted a laptop sleeve with a messenger bag strap - and this provides that. If you need to carry files along with your laptop, I would not recommend this bag. But if you're only looking to move your laptop from point A to point B and will take care when carrying it, then this should work. I'm not sure how much protection it would provide if you dropped it or really knocked it around.

Oh my... we went camping... 4 days and 3 nights in this brand new tent... we were delighted at how much room we had.. for 5 of us... Even the people at the Lake were impressed... our tent was the biggest... lol The air flow was great... the wind didn't knock it over... It rained a for a little while/kind of heavy rain... but no leaks.. we were dry and safe considering a very windy couple days with some rain. It was easy to put up and easy to roll up and put back in its case. Everything worked like clockwork for us... Nothing fell apart. The front piece for over the door... we just didn't tie it down tight enough... Just remember... do not stretch out this tent too tight when putting it up... Or you can see that it just might rip out... We didn't have any issues... It looks like a great tent for the next several years. Our whole family was impressed and so were the relatives...... Happy Camping

My daughter loved this toy so much. My mother in law bought it for her. Even when she wasn't able to reach up and play with it she loves it. Then when she could touch it was the best thing ever. She could be crying and all I had to do was make is sing and she was all better. We used it with her travel system, then when she grew out of that we put it on her bouncy exerciser thing and she loves playing with it still. We did have to replace the batteries once and she is now 8 months and still playing with it.

Ok, I was really doing a lot of research when I was looking into buying an HDTV to accompany my Playstation 3. It was down between name brands for more $$, a Vizio, or this one. First things first, buy LCD and NOT plasma. Plasmas are going out of the light and have a very low life expectancy compared to LCD, hence the reason for their markdowns. This Olevia 42"" is perfect for my bedroom and would serve well as a ""main"" tv for a living room as well. The size is great. The picture quality is amazing! The box says it goes up to 720p and integrated 1080i, but when I booted up my PS3, the display said 1080p!!!! The picture quality is simply stunning, and the audio is also great! If your thinking about getting a new HDTV for gaming, blu ray, HD tv, stop reading this review and spend the $629+plus to get this amazing TV. Don't buy the name brand, look at the specs and technicalities...that's all that really matters. It has a sweet split screen option if you want to prove to your family and friends Blu Ray is WAYYY better, I have done so! The back panel has all you will need for all your home entertainment needs as well. So yes, put your hard decision making thoughts aside, and order this TV NOW and ship it SiteToStore to save on shipping!! Hope this will lead you to making the right decision!

I was delighted with the television but on the 2nd day the backlight went out. I returned it to my local Walmart store with no problem and purchased another 42"" Vizio, just not the same model (they don't carry that model in the stores). But I did also purchase a blu ray player that has wireless Internet and lots of apps...both for $150 less than my original purchase.

This CD is strange to me. There are no slow songs on the entire thing, but some of the songs were okay. I liked Radar, but that was because I bought Circus before this CD and didn't realize that it was on both of them. I also liked Heaven on Earth. The cover makes me throw up. Overall, if you see this and Circus in the store, buy Circus, but if you absolutely love that, then buy Blackout afterwards and you will probably like that as well. Sometimes it takes time to get used to a CD, so listen to it a few times before you make an opinion. But don't buy this unless you're mature. Just the song titles were provocative, and you could tell what type of product you were buying based on them. Enjoy!

I bought this mattress to use with the Dream-on-Me 3 in 1 portable crib. It was the perfect addition to make the crib comfortable and give good support to the baby. The thin mattress that generally comes with most portable cribs is fine when the portable crib is used as a playpen, but does not always work well for good sleeping.

ive own this phone for about 2 months now, the first month it was a great phone, this last month the phone has been horriable, shuting off at random times, turning off in the middle of phone calls. and here recently its been going hay wire, only way i could get this phone to work properly was to have it plugged in. it works ok in the morning but in the afternoons its a different animal. i wouldnt recommend this phone to anyone, your just throwing your money away with this phone

The first thing I noticed about the stroller and carseat was that the lime green color was not as bright as in the pictures online, which was good. I love the pattern, and am glad that it is something that I can use with the girl we're expecting any day, and any other future children-boy or girl.Setting it up was a little difficult. I had trouble getting the stroller to open up, and attaching the brakes and wheels was kind of hard. It took a lot more effort than I thougth it would. The car seat was already put together, and ready to go, except for the straps. Installing the carseat into the car wasn't hard, and I've been practicing getting the seat in and out . It was a little hard at first, but it's getting better. The same with practicing opening and closing the stroller.Overall, I am happy with this product, and am looking forward to using it with my daughter.

Was expecting the Android 2.2 system to support all the full features of its version. Unfortunately, this version does not support Flash, so you are limited in the types of movies/videos you can utilize. Hopefully, that will change with the release of Android 2.3 to this product. Also, disappointed in the ability of the GPS capabilities--unable to use at all in several locations and it seems very tied to needing Wireless (which was also limited in certain locations) and GPS both to get directions. There were inadequate directions for upgrading the Micro SD card, but the support line was pretty helpfulOutside of these two features, it is a great tool, not too hard on the eyes for reading and the apps you can use are very nice to work with. The screen is very responsive to either finger touch or stylus.Overall, satisfied with the product.

I had been watching this technology develope from Japan more than a year ago and Visio had been the first to bring out theater 3D in 720p. Based on the same technology as what you see in the Theater, this TV has impressive 1080p cinama 3D. It uses the same glasses as the ones you get from the movie theater and they do work well I watched the Green Lantern in 3d and it was all stunning. I have a collection of about 12 plus the 4 that was in the package. The only thing I do notice is that there isn't any flickering( a +# and you donot have ghosting #a +# or white pixel objects that occure in your periferal vision #a +)and best of all no head aches(a ++). Visio does have a product like the LG it is called Theater 3D and works close to LG in quality. I had purchased this unit because I use a PS3 to do online movies and such so I didn't need the WIFI capabilities that you get with the more expensave units and it was'nt an issue connecting the PS3. 3D gaming is the best I have seen, ever. Sound is a bit narrow like any slim TV but if you add a surround sound sound , is of course excellent too. I had been waiting for the price drop on the shutter style ""Active"" 3D setup but read about the ""Passive"" tech was close to being perfected. IT would of cost 650 for a converter box and 4 shutter glasses for my Samsung DLP which I heard was a very good 3D view. I redireted my funds to purchase this TV, which I love. This has true 1080p 3D, last years models were only 720p so hopefully this info helps in a difficult discision. Site to store is a great option too.

I purchased this tv in a bundle, the cord was the first to come, then the tv over a week later, and I have still not received the soundsystem yet, but I'm hopeful. This tv is ENORMOUS, its like having my very own movie theatre in my living room. I just love it. I have been saving for quite some time for a flat screen tv and when I saw this in a bundle I went for it, absolutly one of the best buys I have found as of late. The picture is clear and did I mention that this tv is just huge? It is actually much bigger than I had imagined it would be, and I couldn't be happier with it. Definately worth the wait, and I look forward to sampling other products from this company. Do the research though and go to the element website and learn about the company itself (which is actually very refreshing and impressive). I really think this is a great product and I would definately buy it again.

The camera is easy to use for a technically challenged person like myself. Takes very clear pictures. The only thing I don't like about the camera is that there is a short (about a second) delay between when you push the button and the camera actually takes the picture. Otherwise this a very good camera for the money.

We loved this piece, the fabric and function were what was needed. unfortunatly..one of the leg screws was assemebled backwards and we ended up with a 3 leged sofa, not very usefull.We did not have the time to return and wait for another so my son made a few modifications to it and it works OK but I would recomend that it be checked before leaving the store. other wise it was slept on and no complants. however keep in mind, It was smaller than expected, not a good choice for 2 adults or for someone over 6ft.

Connecting - was painless on our three Windows 7 laptops. We couldn't connect the 4th laptop, an HP running Vista. My brother looked around the web and found someone else who had trouble connecting a Compaq running Vista to this modem/router. Updated network drivers fixed it for him. It worked for us as well, but it took a little persistence. Device Manager said our drivers were up-to-date. They weren't, though. We found newer drivers at HP's website.Using it - I'm happy with the wireless range. The modem/router is downstairs, and we get 5 bars everywhere in the house, including upstairs.The connection is fast most of the time. Much faster than the modem/router our ISP provided (which stopped working). But it slows to a crawl often -- every other day, or even twice a day. The connection between the computers and the modem seems to be fine when this happens. It looks like the problem is between the modem and the internet. Unplugging the modem, waiting one minute, and plugging it in again usually restores the speed. So far, anyway. Comments from reviewers elsewhere say their connection slows over time when a setting called IP Flood Detection is enabled. Ours isn't enabled, so that's not it. Perhaps it needs a software update from our ISP? Still trying to figure out what's going on.

I have two Jack Russell Terriers and one is a jumper so I needed a high gate to keep her in the kitchen while I'm at work. The gate being black was a bonus because there is wrought iron in my dining room so it matches nicely. The only problem I do have is that it is an automatically closing gate so we just hooked a bungie cord to it to keep it open when the dogs aren't being locked up. The other thing is it isn't as easy to open as it should be. The mechanism sticks a little bit. Otherwise - great investmen!

I only needed it to rehab my knee which had gotten wobbly over the past few years.I have an ACL injury AKA ""bucket handle tear"" which i think only refers to a cartilidge tear. A piece of cartilidge was removed about 25 years ago arthroscopicaly. I don't think there is any ligament damage.It arrived quickly, with all parts, and assembled in about an hour. There was no need for any mods. I didn't put the preacher accessory on so there is a square hole where the vertical shaft would fit. They could add a square plug to fit the hole so that the occasional brush over the hole won't scratch my knee ( due to the edge ). Or i guess i can duct tape it. It is not high for me as it was for some earlier reviewers. I'm 6 foot, and it accomodates my 220 LB frame ok, and works well for me.A nice touch this has is a captive pin to lock the knee lever making for easy scooting along my carpet so i can stow it away easily. It also can accomodate 2 sizes of holes for weights. I have the smaller size, and the other larger size is the one found in my YMCA.Using it has made a noticeable improvement in my knee making it a good investment.

i'm 57 and not extensively good with electronics. bought this player about 3 weeks ago and am very pleased with it. it doesn't have a lot of different things you need to do to use it. even the most technaically challenged people could use this. i really like the hold button that will not let you change once you set it how you want it and it will make sure it will not turn on without moving the hold button so no accidents. sound is very good and i really like the speaker if you don't want to use the ear buds. even technical people will enjoy this.

I know a lot of bike people knock this bike, but for the money it's a very good buy, in my opinion.It is a big bike, 57cm or 22.5"". You better have at least a 31"" inseam if you want to ride this bike properly. I am 5'8"" with a short 29"" inseam, and this bike was to big for me. I took the bike back for a refund because it's to big, and I didn't like the riding position that it put me in, leaning forward was hard on my neck.I ended up ordering a Hybrid bike on the internet that fits my size better, and has a more upright riding position. I'm 52 years old, but if I was younger and a little taller, then I would have kept this bike.

I ordered these out of desperation--I do most of my work on a computer and was unable to clearly see the screen with my bifocals. The upper distance portion of the glasses did not allow me to read the screen and using the bottom bifocal portion gave me a pain in the neck!I did not really expect these to do what they said but was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. I slipped them behind my regular glasses and suddenly the middle distance area of my vision was incredibly clear. I could see again! I had been concerned that these would not work with my glasses which are prescribed for nearsightedness, astigmatism, and presbyopia but they did!At some point, I plan to get glasses strictly for computer use but until I can afford that, these little PC Peekers are a great alternative. The only thing I would change about them is to make them slightly larger. Otherwise, they've worked well for me.

I'm quite new to Road biking but I've raced BMX as a kid and now do quite a bit of mountain biking so I'm very familiar with bike design and components. Before buying this bike I did a lot of research and all the bikes that had the equipment I wanted was well over $850.00 I'm not sure how I stumbled on to this bike but I'm glad I did. I Read all the great reviews but was still skeptical so I drove over an hour to a walmart that had it in stock to check it out. The first thing I notice was the bike did not look cheap. I was 95% sold when the associate brought the bike off the upper rack effortlessly with one hand. After checking it out for about 15 minutes for fit, frame design and welds, equipment and assembly quality I ended up leaving with the bike. Front wheel was not true but I got out my spoke wrench and trued it in about 5 minutes. No adjustments to brakes or derailuers needed, hat's off the the assembler at that Walmart. I did replace the stem to a 70mm for a better fit and switched the skewers and seatpost from my mountain bike to cut even more weight from this aready light bike. I've put over 200 miles on this bike in a little over a week and it's been great. Lots of great comments from friends that have $1,000.00+ bikes and they are all blown away by what I paid for it. The Shimano 2300 drive train is definately not top of the line but it has been accurate and dependable so far. Time will be the final test.

The Nuvi 350 is small and slim which means it will fit in your shirt pocket with no problem. The mounting hardware lets you snap your Nuvi in and out of the car easily. The mapping software is not perfect, but it doesn't have to be. The beauty of the technology is that you can drive, make mistakes and still be guided back on course. You can leave the house without having the slightest idea of how to get where you are going and get there easily. The Nuvi recalculates your route quickly when you don't follow the suggested route. You can take it on walks to measure your speed and distance covered. It does a great job. Whether you think it is worth the cost (a great price on Walmart.com by the way) is up to you. It would be invaluable to someone whos job required them to be on the road constantly looking for different addresses.Good luck and have fun with it.

This CD was better than i orginaly thought that it would be but as you listen to all the instruments in the music you can hera freddie fender and all the other singers that were heavy rockers that also put out great love baletts that make you sit in the dark and vry because you lost you girl of guy! Either way it is a great CD and Whether you like Adam Lambert or not he is going to make alot of music it's amazing to hear Freedie Fender in his Music and at time you think it is Freddi himself, i highly recommend this CD! The valu, price, and product has all you can get from ADAM for his Debut CD, as the 1st time was not but this time it's right on the $! check it out, but hide the cover as you can see what i mean your friends see that and they'll freak out on you! Happy Lambert Times ahead! Unless he kills hiself with the musice awards performance, but the CD is great even if he was over the top! Pink and several other great artist colllaberate on this CD with him and it rocks! His voice can hit octives Mariah would be scared to try, and Leona Lewis! Happy Holidays! GOD Bless!

We had the umbrella shipped to our home. It arrived 2 days past the ""expected arrival"" date that was stated. There were not any instructions and it was missing a couple of long bolts, clamps, and another part. We didn't take it back or ship it back b/c we really needed an umbrella, so my husband figured it out and used some parts he had around the garage. We've had it about 2 weeks now and it already has a couple of rips. I don't know how long it will last. I wish that I would have spent twice as much money on a better quality product because I'm going to have to buy another one soon anyway. Long story short....it looks nice and the price sounds right, but you're not really saving money if you have to replace it w/i a year.

The Philips 47"" LCD HDTV and the Philips Blu-ray Disc Player are truly remarkable electronic products. I was able to make my connections easily with HDMI cables and the initial set-up process was displayed and explained on screen. I was enjoying HD Cable TV and a brilliantly displayed Blu-ray movie within minutes. These Philip items went beyond my expectations. The sight and sound are awesome. I had researched for months and now I am so satisfied thus far.The high definition experience is extraordinary.The price is right at Walmart. The only problem is that I want to stay up late at night and enjoy the entertainment!

I was a liitle leery seeing guitar products on Wal-mart.com... but at the price, plus the return policy I couldn't go wrong. This little item surprised me. Although I own another Behringer product... I was a little leery... Behringer product have a hit or miss reputation as afar as Pro Products are concerned. THIS ONE IS A HIT... It's a very good clone of the BOSS/ROLAND EQ-7. A few differences, like the very solid plastic case(as opposed to the Roland's metal case) and no center detents on the plastic sliders... but that's OK.... this isn't something you""re gonna be stomping on 20 times in a song, or adjusting 50 times in a set. The sliders are precise and smooth, the on/off switch is consistent. IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES. pure plain and simple... it works and it's inexpensive. The Roland unit retails for about $100... so at $30.... hey give it a shot. FOUR AND A HALF STARS OUT OF FIVE!!!

I bought this camera for my little sister (she's 9 years old). She LOVED it and used it everyday of vacation. A few of the pics look a little grainy but for the price, I can't complain. There was very little delay between pics and the video function was one of her favorite aspects. Overall, this was an excellent purchase for any new camera user.

Three hours into a 12-hour road trip (with grandkids), the bag was in shreds. I don't know how it happened as we made sure we followed all directions; used the enclosed straps to secure the bag to both side rails and cross rails. Had we not made a rest stop when we did, we might have lost our luggage. That was probably the only positive - our lugggage was still in what was left of the bag. Unfortunately, I won't be purchasing any more Reese products.

The handset that I received had been registered to a base unit. When the battery was installed, the lcd screen came up CONNECTING; trying to connect to the base that it had been registered to. I called AT&T, and they said to return handset as it would have to be unregistered from the original base. I returned handset.

Works right out of the box. Plug it in, put in a memory card and turn it on; it's that easy. It has internal memory, but I prefer to use my own SD card. The screen is a good size and is a focal point in our living area. We really enjoy watching videos on it as well. I only have two issues: (1) There isn't alot of manipulation to the photos while using the frame (rotating images, deleting images, etc). You have to make sure the images are the way you want them before viewing them on the frame. (2) Occasionally, the frame wouldn't read the images on my SD card if I tried to manipulate them. The cure was to just turn it off and then back on again.

I bought this product to use wih the surround speakers for my room. I use logitech Z 5300e and these stands work really well. I can adjust the height and the angle of my surround speakers easily. The hold in the middle made me easier to keep messy wires. The material of this product is made very well and each stand is really heavy to guarantee that it is stable enough for your speaker.

This is a great live DVD from a legendary venue. Some other reviews I read before I purchased this DVD complained about the editing, but I think it's stellar. Los Lonely Boys are even better live than they are in the studio. You can see from this performance that they have lots of experience in front of live audiences and that they enjoy interacting with the crowd.I love their version of ""Supper Time"", does it get any more fun than that? Obviously, JoJo Garza is no slouch on the guitar; he's a virtuoso on bass. ""End of a New Beginning"" closes the show, and brings down the house. All the brothers get to show off their chops throughout this performance.Not quite as good as being there, but pretty darn close! Orale!!

My husband and I bought two of this luggage and had used it three times to date. It is a perfect carry on size and rolls around with so much ease. The material is light and sturdy, the zippers are heavy duty and it has extra compartments on the outside that comes handy. We like it so much that we bought three more for our kids to use on our next travel. The only thing I am not sure of is if the pull-up handle is sturdy enough since it wobbles when in use.

As others have said, YOU MUST BUY MORE BALLS. The 75 balls that comes with this doesn't even cover the bottom of the pit. It stays filled with air for the most part, only sometimes when my son is getting in it and he rubs against the nozzle for filling it with air does it loose air. This is because the nozzle opens allowing air to escape. I think the entrance into the pin should have been wider for them to get in and out. Overall, MY SON LOVES THIS!!! I wish I would have bought 2 because it's a little small, and I'd like him to be able to go from one side to the other. I may buy another one later..

The package I received when I placed an order for this was JUST the blu-ray. After searching on-line for a Wal-Mart customer service phone number (they don't put it on the website anymore!), I called and told the rep that I was shipped the wrong product. I had my doubts whether I would receive the correct item, though, because the UPC code on the blu-ray matched the UPC of the DVD-blu-ray-Digital Download pictured on their website. However, the second shipment was correct and I did receive one DVD, one blu-ray, and instructions for the digital download. Not sure why the original mix-up occurred, but if you just get the blu-ray, CALL and tell them it is incorrect. This was on sale when I purchased it ($8), so I believe it was an extremely good value.

Simple, easy installation and set-up. However the actual use is another matter. Still trying to figure out how to arm this thing without disturbing the neighbors (condo residents). The confirmation beeps while being armed are the at the same volume level as the alarm. As the door is opened to exit, the unit emits 30 loud, rapid beeps which continue even after the door is closed. Upon re-entry the unit beeps a few (2-3) times after 20 seconds if not dis-armed. This is the interval that is selected for the alarm to sound, which doesn't happen. I think I will be purchasing a one way ticket for this puppy back to the vendor.

I like this little thing. The sound quality might not be the best, but it serves the purpose for which my husband and I use it--out on our patio balcony. It's small, so I like the size. And I own a Sony Walkman MP3 player, instead of an Ipod, so I have to plug it into the back using an auxillary cable, instead of using the docking station. So it doesn't charge mine while I am using it, but that is OK with me. Overall, I'm pleased with it.

I looked at a lot of reviews before purchasing my steam mop. I am very impressed with this mop!! The head is small enough to fit under things and it swivels all around. It made my hardwood floors look better than anything I have used. It is steam so it leaves the floor damp but dries within minutes. No streaks, and it is only water, woohoo no chemical cleaners required.I have 3 dogs and 3 cats and this keeps my floors clean!

Very pleased with this product. The chairs are constructed very well and coordinate well with my formal dining room chairs when I need to add a few places. No one would guess they are folding chairs. Nice cushion for comfort. Higher back than most folding chairs. It would be nice if they had a locking mechanism for when putting them away so the seat would stay up, but since they are usually stacked against each other, not really critical.

With the help of this wireless system, we can listen to our old radio stations from back home via the internet in any room in the house or around the pool. We are very impressed with the quality and performance of this product. The only thing I would re-do about the model design is having to use 6 C-cell batteries per speaker if there is no outlet. Other than that, it is great!!!

The family purchased this TV for our Dad for Christmas. It replaced an old TV sitting on top of the refrigerator in the Kitchen. Looks great, amazing picture and good sound. It has the digital converter and is wide screen which will support the upcoming digital conversion. The only thing is that the picture does seem to cut off some of the captions along the bottom or top edge of the screen. That may change when the Digital conversion takes place in February. It's perfect for the kitchen, a child's room, office or a small bedroom. The picture is really great.We also purchased the Philips MANT940 Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna which is just sitting behind the TV on top of the fridge.

The Coby CSP 96 5.1 Home Stereo more than meeting my expectations.I was originally looking for something to hook up to the HDTV TV since the speakers it came in were weak and lacking decent bass. For ~$50, this really does everything that I need it to do. Granted, the bass isn't really that deep neither are the sounds of the higher-frequencies coming from the other speakers, but I'm no audiophile so totally works for me.THe stereo has two types of inputs: a) via RCA plugs (red + white) b) true 5.1 plugs for each of the center, right, left, surround left, surround right, and bass connections. In my case, since I don't have true 5.1 output from my HDTV, I connect the headset output from the TV to the stereo using regular RCA red/white plugs. In my connection, there's really no surround or anything since all 6 channels are driven by the same signal, again, this works for me perfectly.WOuld recommend to anyone who doesn't care much about true surround

I bought this because I've been trying to wear my hair more natural and I didn't really even see a difference in my natural curls at all. Maybe I should have bought a different version? Which I didn't in the first place because all the creative loopy names really just confused me. I wasn't aware of what exactly would be best for my kind of curls. More clarification needs to be provided for that. The smell was nice but eventually it started to make me sick throughout the day. That wasnt fun. No what I expected.

I purchased these cordless phones for my parents for Christmas. They had 5.8 Mhz digital cordless phones before and the reception was terrible. We have wireless internet and there was always interference. These new phones 6.0 come in crystal clear and have many great features. Speakerphone, intercom, paging, etc. My parents love them and can now hold conversations on the phone without getting frustrated and hanging up. I would highly recommend them if one is in the market for cordless phones with an answering machine.

I brought this product for my king sized bed. If you are using for a king size you have to realize that the middle portion does not run across the bed but up and down from top to bottom which I dont feel gives enough support... especially if your frame comes in 2 parts like mine. Also I never could get the middle portion to line up straight. I would not buy this again.

i love this seat for so many reasons! its a breeze to put in! you never will have to rethread the latch system since it has its own latch for rear facing and forward facing! this seat has a lot of growing room. i have read other reviews about the harness being too short. its not if you read the directions that come with it, you will learn that you have to adjust the loops on the harness with the spliter plate on the back, super simple to do! easy to tighten and loosen the harness. my two year old still rides rear facing and he has a ton of room left for growing. i like the idea that he can be in this until he hits 65 lbs unless he out grows it in height. my seat is a different color but he already split some juice on the seat cover. its easy to take off and wash. i liked it when he splilled his drink and the top stayed dry to the touch. i am very happy with my new seat. i had him in the cosco alpha mega until i found this seat. this seat is the only seat (so far) that is 40 lbs for rear facing. keep your babies rear facing as long as possible its 5x safer!

I purchased this for my 4 yr old son for his birthday. He absolutely loves his ""hot rod"" as he calls it. He has no problem reaching the pedals but we have a gravel driveway and he has a very hard time making it go due to the front wheel made of hard plastic.On our sidewalk he has no problem. I hope as he gets bigger he will have less of a problem making it go. I also had assembled the front wheel wrong and had to remove the pedals after putting them on the first time and now they keep coming off. I called Radio Flyer and they are shipping new pedals at NO CHARGE! I was very impressed and very happy.

One of the best ear bud headphones. Remarkably, this ear bud reproduces great sound at all spectrum. It has clear and defined low bass and fantastic highs. You will sure to appreciate it as much as I have...if the price is bit high, even though it is worth it, try the Sony mdr-ex300, its also a very good headphones; same design and just about the same performance at half the cost.

These were great for me, and though some people pointed out that they don't lock, they actually do. There is a lip under each side of the lid. It's a bit tricky, but if you angle it so one side is ""locked"" and then push down on the other side it WILL lock. I'm very happry with them.

I personally love both the books and the movie! Every movie has parts left out of it if it is based off a book. If they didn't take parts out then the movie would have to be a 5 hour movie or longer. I have read all of the books and the parts they took out were the director and Stephenie Meyers decision. I like the fact that Kristen Stewart is playing Bella, she plays the role very well, especially for her having to live up to the expectations from the book. I highly disapprove of all of the people who bash either the book or the movie. I highly recommend buying all for books from the Twilight Saga as well as the movie.

The reviews on this product were good, I did my research, however I purchased a set that had a few defects. Some of the bolts were tough to turn (though we were able to assemble) and there was a scratch on some of the chairbacks. The table top started to split about 2 days after assembly. As more time goes buy, the split gets wider.BUYER BEWARE... if you call the number for the Warranty, you won't reach anyone quickly. I never did, so I emailed my defect issue, and received two less than helpful responses and 'apologies for the inconvenience' on what should have been covered by the limited warranty as per the booklet that accompanied the set. I was never able to get a name of a person or supervisor to discuss my warranty issue either.You will be required to return the defective portion of the table to the store if you are within the exchange period (though the booklet does not indicate this). In my case, the defective part is the whole table top. If I have to disassemble a table to take a part back, I am returning the set and not doing the exchange (though Walmart is great and offers both partial exchange for the defective portion and return options).I am a single mom with a 4-door sedan. Moving large furniture is a bit more than inconvenient.At this point, I feel it is worth the higher price to purchase a table from a furniture retailer that comes with a warranty in which they send out a service representative.

Directions to put the gate together are confusing, but once understood it was fairly easy to install. Only problem is that the small pet door at the bottom of the gate is too big. My german shepherd dog is able to squeeze through it! I've had to put a block of wood on part of the opening to prevent this.

I bought this chair as a Fathers Day present for my husband. He has alot of back pain and this is great with built in heat and massage in the chair and foot rest. It has a hand held remote too.It's a nice microfiber and VERY comfortable!!!My husband LOVES it! The only thing I would change is the noise it makes during the highest intensity cycle. Other than that it's great!

I have only had this product for a couple of weeks, but the set up and back-up of our main hard drive was super simple. I will be using this hard drive primarily to back up our main hard drive and to have extra space for working on home video's. So far it seems to work great. Fortunately our computer hasn't crashed yet to find out how it works for recovery, but it helps with peace of mind.

I am a licensed nail technician and this foot spa is a good value for the price. Unlike some other foot spas, you can choose vibration or vibration and bubbles. This product does not heat the water, but even professional foot spas do not heat the water. The heat will last longer if you do not use the bubble setting or you will have to add hot water to keep it warm. I don't use the attachments because they are hard and plastic, but I didn't buy this product for the attachments.

I purchased the hp 1050 on walmart.com and was happy with purchase price and received printer in a respectful time frame. I unboxed the printer and tried for over 90 minutes to get it to work. I then called an hp tech and they attempted for over 90 minutes with no sucess. Hp then credited my account and will send a paid postage container to send the unit back. Hp gave me more than what I paid in credit to purchase another printer. You can not judge this product by my experence because sometime you get a lemon and other times you get lemonade.

I've purchased 2 of these... well rather, I got a new one after taking the old one back. The first one, well, same problem as other reviews.. it cracked and eventually broke off.. Although my husband found it rather amusing when I started screaming because I got scared half to death when I turned my shower on one day and- instead of the normal stream as one would come to expect- water (very cold water I might add) was squirting all over the place... I trade to fight it off as one would a monster in a bad dream, but didn't have to worry about it long because once the shower head was being unscrewed, it just broke off.The second one I got (the replacement- the same one) for some reason.. the normal setting we had it set to was fine.. then one day my husband and I both noticed it felt like we were being sand blasted.. like the holes had gotten plugged up with gunk or something. So we just turned it to a different setting, which would be fine except that the lower setting has a lot less pressure (I am not reffering to either the massage setting or the mist, rather, the other two.) therefor making it take longer to rinse off.. then about a week later, whaddya know.. there was another crack. We removed the shower head and just popped off the turn dial to see if there was, in fact, some sort of build up.. and couldn't find any.All-in-all, we will NOT be purchasing this product again... serves us right for trying to go cheap anyhow I suppose.Also, if it helps:The first shower head crack within about 3 months, the second, in about 4 months.

I was given a free bottle of this product to use if my son needed it. I'm very happy that the Infant's Advil is dye-free. I like to keep things simple, and dye-free keeps this medication simple. My son has constant ear infections with fever, so it didn't take long after receiving my free product we had to try it out. I was happy this ""broke"" his fever, but no faster than another product we used previously. For my son I was glad it didn't upset his stomach like other fever reducers have in the past. Would I use Infant's Advil for my son again? Yes. It worked for us.

My 20 month old daughter is safe and snug in her new full-sized bed, thanks to this double rail system. I don't remember having much choice as to what I purchased because we needed a double rail, rather than a single rail; single rails are easy to come by.We could not use her convertible crib as a toddler bed b/c set did not come with rails, nor could we purchase rails that fit a toddler bed - crazy! SO, we now use the head and foot boards from her crib with a full-size mattress and the rails work just right.As a very picky consumer, I'd recommend this product.

Everything works as advertised. Price is good and value is high for the price. Speakerphone is very handy and volume control is excellent. It will take a little while to get used to the keys. They are large and easy to use and they are very sensitive. I had couple of repeated digits because of this, but I'm better at it now. There is a headphone jack and a dedicated headphone button, so you can leave the headphone plugged in if you like.

We found the bike more difficult to assemble than most of the reviews I've seen here. We even had to call customer service when we couldn't get the tension cable to attach correctly. It would be helpful if the instructions said you could pull on it very hard. We were afraid to try that in case we broke something.The different modes on the computer screen are hard to see for me. Particularly if there is a lack of strong light. I can't seem to get the timer to set most days. Other than those two things, I recommend this bike. It's a good value for the money.

I have been using this pump for 7 months now with high and frequent use (pumping 4-5 times per day). Its easy to use and clean. The one-handed pumping feature is a necessity so I can work, read or cuddle a little one while pumping. My motor just now gave out on it so I will have to buy another but that still means that I will have only spent $140 total on pumps (i plan on nursing for a year). I have used a medela symphony a few times at work and have not seen any difference other than the bonus of being able to pump one-handed with the miPump. The shields on the mipump did make me pretty sore at first but I used a bit of lanisah cream before pumping & that problem was solved. Great pump and well worth the price!

We only used distilled water and this humidifier worked great for about one day. Then the mist stopped coming out. We took the tank off and dumped the water out of the base like the manual suggested. It still didn't work. I found that under the white 'hat', the part that directs the mist, there is a plastic grate. I'm not exactly sure why it's there. The grate actually clogs up with the water droplets (the same way bubble soap fills a plastic ring). No matter what setting, this still happened occasionally. Now, after only about 7 days, the fan is still working, but the ultrasonic part no longer works. Bottom line, no mist and I will have to find the box and return. Also, same annoying flaws already covered in other reviews.

Thsi corner TV stand was not very difficult to set up. The instructions were clear, although one piece was challenging to identify. One set of screw holes was slightly off, but that did not affect the final look (they were on the base) The corner shape means that storage amount behind the doors is limited to the width of a DVD case. This looks a lot more expensive than it cost. The height (291/2"")was exactly what we needed to allow the TV to be placed next to an upright piano and still be visible to the entire room.

I really like this resistance band! It offers enough resistance to replace push-ups. It's nice not to have to get down on the dirty floor to do your push-ups.It's also really good for triceps extensions. Now I can workout my triceps, which I consider an awkward exercise, while feeling much safer, without fearing that I'll drop the weight on myself. I also like the way it attaches easily to your door!However, I don't feel it gives enough resistance for biceps and lats(your back muscles). I still prefer free weights for those muscle groups. I also don't like the way it makes your hands smell like rubber. I have to wash my hands after I use the band and my hands still smell for hours afterwards.

All worked as advertised. I used to have very noisy service with my land line. Now it is so clean that people have noted how clear it is.Installing was easy and I like that it is hooked up to my router, so I can shut down my computer and still have phone service.I had an issue with email notifications of voice mail. It turned out it had nothing to do with NetTalk. It was my spam filter. So make sure to check that. One last thing, if it is important for you to make international calls, you MUST have a PayPal account to pay for it. At this time it's the only method of payment.

Bought this shortly after christmas for my Xbox 360 so I could do love without stringing an ethernet cable across the room. Read the reviews but decided to try it out anyways just due to the price. After a quick call to tech support to find out it doesnt ""talk well"" with Comcast modems. It was up and running. Have had no problems with it since I bought it. Even after swithcing the hard drive on the computer it still worked without even installing the software. Have had absolutely NO problems with this whatsoever. Best buy for the money AND XBOX 360 compatible.

The product is a great value. It puts out an exceptional amount of cool steam with no noise. On its lowest setting it lasts for days on a single tank. On its highest setting, it lasts about 10-12 hours. Easy-to-use. One occasional problem: on the bottom of the reservoir is a small spring-release valve that lets water pass from the reservoir to the ultrasonic steam generator. The valve does not always depress sufficiently to let water flow. This happens infrequently and is easy to fix by removing and re-seating the reservoir on the base. Nevertheless, a bit annoying.

The opening Cruiserweight invitational was well done as you many nearfalls throughout the match. In the end Helms steals the win. I would give this match an 8.5 as it was a fantastic opener but could have gone longer. The encounter between JBL and Bobby Lashley featured plenty of power moves and many near falls. It ended however when Fit finlay interfered hitting BL in the back of the head with a shilleigh enabling JBL to hit the Clothesline. I'll will give this a 7 for the effort but the FF interference kinda hurt this one. The non-title match between MNM and Matt Hardy/Tatanka was easily one out of three matches of the night. Both teams tried to keep the other ones grounded throughout the entire course of the match. It featured a lot of high flying from MH and Ta and in the end TA comes off the tope rope and pins one guy while MH pins the other. I will give this a 10 out of 10 as it had everyone standing in their seats. The next one was Chris Benoit vsBooker T for the US Title. This was a classic as they both employed power moves galore and there were many near falls. BT worked on CB's arm throughout the course of the match but in the end was forced to submit to the crossface and CB regains the title. I'll give this a 10 out of 10 as it met my expectations and so much more. Rey Mysterio Vs Randy Orton was very well done with RM using his quickness to counter the power moves of RO. RO however ruined the ending of this match by rolling up RM and then grabbing the ropes for leverage. It cheapened his win. I'll give this one an 8.5 but the bad ending ruined it. The Main event of Undertaker Vs Kurt Angle for the World Heavyweight Championship was a war of Power Vs Quickness. It was a good back and forth match so that both men employed their trademark maneuvers including the Tombstone Piledriver and the Ankle Lock. There were many near falls as well. The end came when the UT had a submission move locked around the head of KA and he rolled him over to pin him and retain the title. All in all, one of the Better No Way Outs put out in Recent years but it's still hard to top the NWO 2004.

My husband and I purchased this matress in a Queen size and being we didn't need a box spring for the frame we chose, you couldn't beat the price.It came quite compacted and took a few days to fluff up and it also had a very nice zip covering over it that can be removed and washed.We were quite impressed once it fluffed up, however the first night of sleeping on our new matress, it seemed quite stiff for being a foam matress and now that we've had it for a few weeks it seems to not be as stiff and you do seem to be contoured into it when drifting off to sleep. We've definately been sleeping a lot better.It's worth buying and giving it a try.

This system fits my needs quite well. I do computer graphics work that is very processor and memory intensive. This system is strong on the two features I need most.The first thing I did when I received this system was to run a bench mark test in one of my most used 3d animation suites. This computer renders almost 5 times faster than my previous quad core system! I was accustomed to waiting hours for an image to render. This system will speed up my work considerably.As other reviewers have pointed out, a better graphics card and a higher wattage power supply would be good if you're going to be doing heavy gaming. However, despite what one might think, a high end graphics card isn't really needed for most 3d modeling/animation/video rendering work. The one included in this system appears to work just fine for my purposes.Other reviews have mentioned that the case was of poor quality. True, it is nothing fancy but it was better than I was expecting. Most of it it feels fairly sturdy, looks nice and the system runs very quietly. Some of the metal covers in the back panel are quite thin though.I'm no expert on monitors but the 23"" Hannspree that comes with this package looks quite nice to me. It's big, bright, even and clear.This is quite a powerful system at an exceptional price.

simple to assemble, quiet and smooth motions. I highly reccomend this product. Small drawback, theres no off switch on the little timer/distance computer. It does shut off on its own only if you reset the computer back to 0 and leave it alone. Folds up for easy storage is great. Very sturdy and efficient. I have owned it for 3 weeks now and its definately paying for itself. Great product if you want low impact on joints and knees, especially if you have a bad knee like I do. Great product I would reccomend it to anyone.

The first thing you notice is how light this TV is. It made me concerned the quality might be poor, as we tend to expect more valuable things to be heavier for some reason. Not the case with this TV. We've only been using it for a week, but it is exactly what we expected -- a very basic HDTV with fair sound quality and very good picture quality. Setup was easy and it is easy to operate. The remote control looks like it was designed by a grade schooler. The buttons are really not arranged in any logical fashion and there are at least three ways to access every menu option from the remote, which seems like overkill. Overall, I'm happy for the price we paid, which was about half of similar sized LCD televisions capable of 1080p picture quality with HDMI input.

We bought this game for our 4 and a half yr old daughter, and she LOVES IT! She caught on really quickly how to move about. I like how there's no time limit to anything. They have plenty of time to turn back around if they had forgotten any items. Its neat to see her playing a video game at such a young age, enjoying herself while she's twirling around the control (used as the wand). I'm very pleased with this game. Value, price and all.

My 2 sons are 3 and 11. They LOVE it!However, We found it hard to assemble, 9 hours with 3 people!!Instruction lacks measurements where to place boards and we had to disassemble 2 times in certain parts of the clubhouse.Once together though it is a great value for the price. Wood is realy cedar and it smells wonderful. The coilor is very pleasing to the eye also.The sliding board took 1 hour alone to assemble, ( it is not one piece sliding board, it is 5!)In the end to see the kids enjoy it is priceless!Just remeber set aside a whole day and get a couple friends to help!

Good game but it has it's glitches. for ex- in backgammon when putting men in home box- if you have any other pieces that can move 4 spaces without going into home box- the game will not allow you to move your pieces on the 4 space into home box. This makes it more challenging to win.

Received my PS3 in about a week thru site to store shipping. When I got it home and plugged it in it would not turn on, customer service said it was a defective hard drive... this shows that although the sticker on the box says ""quality tested"" it was NOT quality tested before it left the warehouse. Waste of my time. Brought back for full refund @ Walmart no questions asked. Unfortunately I don't have a ps3 tho

Minn Kota has been on the top of trolling motors from their beginning. Not that there are not other good trolling motors but few are as well known for so many places. I have not had the opportunity to use this item as we are entering winter with a bite in the air. Will be easy to build a ""Transom"" mount for my 17' Old Town canoe. I am presently seeking which battery and a solar panel recharge or maintain source of energy while camping and moving further upstream. I do not fish calm waters. I run canoes on rivers and have since I was in my mid teens. This will be used primarily for moving upstream against currents. New Mexico is not known, particularly those who live here, that canoe's can be run on rivers. My canoe is designed for rivers. I look forward to using this trolling motor on live waters. Both Walmart and Minn Kota stand behind their products.

Okay, I got this 360 because it was cheap. I didn't want to save up a few more bucks to get the regular system because I saw no point. Bad idea. This Xbox is trash. For many of my games (recent ones only it seems) like Left 4 Dead, Gears of War 2, and Fable 2 it CONSTANTLY freezes. Did some research online and found out Xbox Arcade Systems naturally have more trouble processing the newer games. Seriously, unless you have the patience to restart your counsle every 30 minutes, save your money for an Elite or something. This product is grade A junk.

We had originally bought this sound bar at Target for $100 loved it. Decided to get another one and checked Walmart, the price was alot lower! I ordered it on line and had it shipped to the store for FREE! It is very sleek and gives off great sound. It is a great addition to the new HD Tv's. The Ipod dock is wonderful. You have the option to play your ipod, radio, dvd or just the tv. Just goes to show you Walmart truly does have lower prices!!

First be aware that the ""red"" one is more of a deep pinkish red...not a true red in any way. The reviews that say it scratches easily are not kidding. I put it in my purse when I first got it and the next day there was a scratch across the screen, which was really disappointing. And it had been in its own pocket. I've had it for a year and a half now and it looks like it's ten years old, the paint is worn off all over and the screen is covered in scratches. And I'm very careful how I care for my things. So I am disappointed in it's durability. HOWEVER, it has speakers which is nice. I've connected it to computer speakers #without the computer# and it's loud and clear enough to hear over a treadmill that way. It has a great battery life and continues to operate really well!! I am looking to purchase a different player, however, simply because there isn't any way on the device itself to create/delete/edit playlists. It all has to be done through the computer and once it's done, it's done, unless you go back into the computer. Would like the player to be more self-sufficient that way and am thinking the touch screen ones might be. As far as quality of sound and performance, though, it's been terrific. Just couldn't rate it more than average because of the cosmetic factor and playlist trouble.

This is a very nice table. Sturdy and well designed. I also like the net system as it keeps the net very firm across the table.The only complaint I would have is that some of the bolts used are wing nuts. I personally do not like wing nuts as they can break if over tightened. Actually, I broke one. But simly replaced it with a standard nut.This is the best table for the price I could find.

I do like this grill. It is a really nice size and looks good as well. It's so easy to remove the grills and clean. The only thing I do not like is that it does not brown as well as my small GF grill. Not too good for grilled sandwiches and the chicken breast was done before it was browned. Maybe I'll try another setting next time. I'm still getting used to it.

The Fisher Price Little People A-Z Zoo is a great addition to the other LP products we have for our two children, 3 yr and 1yr. We bought this for our 1 yr old daughter knowing very well that our 3 yr old son would also enjoy 26 NEW animals to his collection of LP Farm, Playground, and many others!The sounds are nice to learn and there is a setting for Alphabet so when a picture or letter is pressed it will play the appropriate letter name or sound.This set, like other LP sets, can connect to other pieces like the farm, jungle, and more.Great buy for kids 1-4 years old!

I bought this to make the No Knead recipe and decided that this was the best deal out of all because it has a top you can cook in making it a 2 for 1 bargin. So far it does the job. I do believe that Lodge could do a better job deburring the sharp spots on the handles. Yes, you will be using pot holders most of the time but the sharp spots chew up the pot holders.

I thought this illustration of the events in the Bible is holds true to the Bible itself. The movie is filled with scripture and does a great job depicting the events.Note that this movie is rated PG and although animated, it is not a Saturday morning 'cartoon'. Plagues are scary as is the wrath of God. I'm glad this movie didn't water those aspects of the Bible down. Although perhaps not appropriate for a 3-4 year old, I feel it is appropriate for a 6 year old especially when watching it with parents.The video and audio quality is very good as well and I'm very happy with it.

This airbed is the best I have ever slept on and I have slept on quite a few. The height is great and the comfort level is very impressive. The only bad thing is that it has had to be 'patched' twice already. If it gets another leak I may have to exchange it for a new one as this one may be a 'lemon'. Notwithstanding the 'patching' I am very pleased with this purchase.

Unless you have about 40 minutes to let your floor dry from so-called ""steam"", I would not recommend this steam mop. It left my floors soaking wet. If I dumped a bucket of very hot water on the floor, it would have the same effect. This is going back to the store. It NEVER gets hot enough to sanitize your floors, don't be fooled. A waste of money.

I have had the bed not quite a month yet. I have used it nightly since it's arrival.I really am totally impressed with this bed!!!I moved into a studio apartment recently. I got the insta bed to be temporary until the sleeper sofa I ordered arrived. However, this one will be kept and stored so when I eventually move into an apartment with a bedroom this WILL be my full time regular bed.The shipping was quick at it arrived even a day sooner than they said it would.It is every bit as comfortable (maybe more so!) to sleep on as a quality conventional mattress. So far it has not lost air (deflated unexpectedly) at all at any time. Has not suffered any damage or had to be repaired and I inflate it as full as possible. I had no problems getting the back ""seating"" feature deflated entirely so it was totally flat for sleeping. Once completely deflated, I was able to fit it back into the nice large carry bag that comes with it.If you have pets, just to take common sense care and precautions. The bed is flocked on top, but I suggest a nice thick mattress pad as well if your furry friends sleep with you.I do wish there was a slightly smaller full size version since it is just me. I could only find queen in this particular model. I was dead set on getting the insta-flex adjustable features though! It is true to the queen size and those linens fit perfectly. Since it is raised, it is the same height as if you had a conventional box spring and mattress on a frame!The insta flex adjustable features that make it like a ""hospital"" bed (for lack of a better word) work fine. They each inflate and deflate separately which is great. You can quickly adjust them to your comfort level.It inflates fairly quickly; takes a few minutes longer to totally deflate.Love the built in pump (rather than having to attach one) and I didn't find it too noisy.Negatives:I have only two small issues that really wouldn't keep me from buying this bed again or recommending it.I wish the remote had a button or switch that kept the motor on to deflate or inflate without you having to keep your thumb or finger pressed on it the whole time. That way you could be free to tend to something else while the bed does it's thing.Others have mentioned the ""concave"" issue. It is slightly higher on the sides so you do tend to be forced slightly to middle of the bed. Just the way it is designed which could be improved. I could see how this could be more of a problem sleeping with a partner. I did not feel I was sinking or being swallowed into the bed ever. It isn't that drastic. But this issue is what keeps me from giving this bed the full 5 stars all the way.Over all, I think this is probably the best inflatable bed you could buy and an excellent value for the price.

What a great product this is. With all the available functions, it seriously rivals the I-touch at a fraction of the price. I'm really suprised that Wal-Mart does not have this product in the store. It would fly off the shelves. I searched for a product comprable to the Itouch at less cost and could not find one until now. I just received it in the mail a couple days ago and I was very pleased that headphones and a protective cover were included. I will be buying 2 additional ematics for other children now.

I find this product to be of poor quality in every respect. The cover on the battery compartment of the head-set, is hard to open and tends to fall off. I get lots of static from the head phones and I can't figure where or why. The Head-set I replaced never gave me static, it just wore out.I have to say I guess you get what you pay for. This is an in-expensive product, and the quality seems to reflect that.

For the price this cabinet is worthy. While putting this together, the corners of the cupboards broke off. This made the cabinet more a shelving unit, rather than a cabinet.So... I called the 1-800 number in the package. This connected me with a person, not a recording. I told my Customer Service Representative, of the damage done. He sent replacement doors out, no charge to me. Therefore, buy any Zenith, Inc product from Wal Mart!

Can't really comment on the comfort level, because I bought it simply to use as a headboard for my queen size bed. The ""full"" size is a perfect length for a queen headboard application. It's great to lean up against reading or watching tv and it's good for blocking out the chill from the wall and the noise from the apartment complex parking lot. And in a pinch I guess it could easily be removed from behind the bed and used to accommodate an unexpected house guest.

This is a well made product. It saves money because you don't need a crib bumper in addition to the tent. It keeps cats out and kids in. Plus, it adds a fun twist to baby's bed. When my boy gets older, maybe he'll feel like he's camping out every night! It's a great concept and works great. My cat can't get in which is why we bought it.

It was covered with dust & spider webs, I brushed it off & tried it out this past weekend, Works Great. I bought the new one for my Master bedroom & bath. I can keep the central heat off & this heater on low keeps my large master suite very warm & saves money on my heating bill. I have had the other one for 3 years. It has a metal exterior, no cheap plastic to crack! If the dogs knock it over, it shuts off. Great value for the money.

I LOVE this lash growth serum!!!! My eyelashes are Sooo much Longer & Thicker!!! I use it in the morning under my makeup and at night. I apply it like an eyeliner at the base of my top lashes on the lash line,only using the little soft brush at the end. I haven't had any irritation at all! The ingredients are really good in this,the same as the high-end peptide lash serums...peptides encourage eyelash growth through stimulating the keratin genes responsible for long, thick lashes, without any side effects!!I will def purchase again!

I admit the first one would over heat and shut down after 30 minutes of use. I knew this was a unique problem, as none of the dozens of website reviews I read before i bought it ever mentioned this probelm, nor any other problems.Comes with small rabbit ears antenna (picks up all digital channels in Norfolk, VA area), wireless remote, short USB cable, tuner, and VGA cable.Sharper picture on my 16 in Laptop than on LCD TVs. Very clear sound.If you use Windows 7 (64 bit), you don't need to use the driver/software CD at all. Just plug it in and it works. works well with W7 Media Center for channel selection and can even set up to record shows.It's one of the least expensive, but not at all short on quality. Highly recommend.

I bought these bottles in desperation to help my son's spitting up and gas. I was told what a miracle these bottles are. I was first disappointed in the cleaning and assembly. However, I was willing to do anything that would work. Not only did they NOT work, his gas, burping, and spitting up probably tripled! I then gave these several more tries wanting to eliminate the possibility of a coincidence. Nope, it was the bottles! I went back to his simple Soothies. He still has trouble with gas sometimes, but it is nothing compared to his agony with these bottles!

This is a stunning product. I got a Magnavox blu-ray player on Black Friday for $60 but it didnt have Youtube, Netflix and any of those features (it had only Vudu) and so I came to return it. Thats when I saw this beauty of a player for $94 in Walmart and I told my dad to get it immediately. Since I have a backup wireless router (it connects to my main router wirelessly), I was able to set it all up for no additional cost (if you dont have a seperate router, you need to get the USB wireless adapter). It works like a charm. The Youtube, Netflix, Pandora, Amazon VOD, etc are all breezy and superb. Only thing is, typing the search fields in Youtube, Pandora, Dailymotion, etc with the remote takes lot of time (the keys are setup like the cell phone where 'abc' are on key 2). With an HDTV, this player is a rocking purchase for the price in which it is sold. Completely recommended! It plays Video CD's too and it plays from USB drive (the USB port is in the back, which is another minor negative).

This seat has served us well. I got it when my daughter was about 6 months old and had grown out of her infant seat. She is now over 2 years old. It has held up pretty well. The straps are a pain in the neck, though. I know some people have trouble with the straps, and though we didn't have trouble, per se, it just takes a while longer to strap her in. I have a new baby now and I decided to go with a Britax Boulevard for the new baby. I am very tall and have very tall kids, so I figure the $300 for the Boulevard will actually be saving me money in the long run. For my older daughter, we spent $100 on the infant seat, $150 for the triumph, and now we need to get her a bigger seat, because she is too tall for the Triumph, and she's only 26 months old! So it looks like we'll be getting her a Britax Regent for $270. So, I've spent over $520 now when I could have just spent $299 to begin with and had one car seat fit her all the way through. Oh well, live and learn.But for those of you who have small kids, this seat is fine. But I've decided that the extra safety features, especially the side impact protection on the Britax is worth more to me than any amount of money.

This trash can is definitely not big enough for a kitchen. At most, it can hold enough for a bedroom. I bought this to use in my dorm in our kitchen. I was EXTREMELY dissapointed when I saw how small this is. This trash can/recycling bin can only hold paper and maybe 3 water bottles AT MOST.

I bought this monitor after my son threw his old one in our dog's water bowl :-) oops.I researched several different monitors and compared prices online for about a week before I decided to go with this one. I really liked the idea of dual monitors (the one we had before just had one). Overall it works really well. The only thing is that it has some feedback occasionally when you walk by it.. depending on how loud you have the reciever turned up. The lights on it are a great feature too because you can ""see"" the noise even if you dont have it turned up very loud. The night light is okay.. not too bright. My son never had one before we bought this so it hasnt really made much of a difference. Anyway, great product!

I was skeptical about these inflatable pools, but this one suprised me. It was an easy set-up, but it does take forever to fill up when using a garden hose. Rather than an air compressor to fill the outer bladders, I used a shop vac in reverse to blow air in through the air release vents. It went really quick. I have stored it up to one week inflated in my garage and it held the air. The debris cover is great. It is a very nice addition and helps if you have to let the pool sit for some time to let the water warm up if your culinary water is too cold for immediate swimming. Solid product.

Well, i looked up a bunch of reviews that all said good, but i say BAD. the BB goes about 20 feet then it goes up and completely misses! It was just not worth it. I really feel like a fool now that i bought it. and the slide is supposed to lock when your out of ammo, but it locks even if the magazine is full. I hope i saved you from losing 19 dollars!

We purchased this air mattress/bed to use with my 86 year old grandmother who was coming to stay with us for 11 days. We have no spare room and no spare bed of any kind...No pull-out couch, no futon, no other beds. This inflated with the electric pump (included) in a matter of minutes. It stays pretty well inflated and only needs a bit more air added every couple of days, just to keep it extremely firm. The only negative I have to report about this product is regarding the electric pump. The first time I used the pump, it hooked onto the mattress air hole very easily, and stayed completely hooked up the entire time it was inflating without a hand holding onto it. But the next time I went to use it, it wouldn't ""latch on"" to the hole as easily and it wouldn't stay hooked while inflating. It needed me to hold it and push with a little force to keep air from leaking while it was inflating. I am not sure why this happened. I read the directions and followed them exactly. But even though I had a small issue with the pump, it still inflated the product and the mattress stayed pretty well inflated the entire 11 days while my grandmother slept on it. Even the little ones and I layed on it (and in my 2 year old's case, jumped on it) and it still held up. Like I said already, it just needed a bit of air added every couple of days to keep it firm. I am happy with this purchase.

I had a hard time deciding what stroller to purchase, but the first time I used this stroller, I knew I made the right decision. It was much less expensive than most double jogging strollers, but the quality is good. We also own a single child jeep jogging stroller, but the quality of this stroller is much better and honestly probably easier to maneuver with two children in it, than the jeep is with just one.

This product was described online as - works with ALL ipods shuffle products, It wasn't until I had opened the plastic casing and read further into the paperwork that there was a 'disclaimer' saying it did not work with ipod shuffle, FIRST GENERATION, which is the kind of ipod I have. So, I don't know how it works with compatible products. I returned it to a store for a refund.

This desk goes together well and is quite functional. Installing the cabinet on the top is a bit of a pain but that's a minor gripe.Once assembled this desk should be quite useful for anyone who isn't expecting to pass it down as a family heirloom. Assembly itself can be kind of frustrating from time to time since some of the screw holes have very thin guides put into the wood, and a power screwdriver is basically a must unless you've got biceps thicker than your neck. The finish on the wood is also a little ratty in places (the bottom of that cabinet door is the big one).However, for the price, it is still a very good desk. The cabinet and shelf space is adequate, the CD storage is a nice feature, and the L shape provides a ton of work area for a relatively small desk footprint. It's not very pretty but it does work quite well, and I would highly recommend it for the price Walmart is charging.

We just recently got this diaper pail to replace our Diaper Champ, which we did not like at all. The Diaper Champ was hard to use and there was a horrible diaper smell in the room. This one works great! You can't even hear the fans running, but there is no diaper smell in the room at all. Also, it is so easy to use, you just open the lid, set the diaper in and close the lid, there is no twisting or anything. It does kind of make a loud clicking sound when you close the lid, but it is not that loud and it doesn't bother my son. Overall, this is a great diaper pail!

Many reviews mention damaged or missing parts and difficult assembly, NOT HERE. The trike arrived complete and undamaged. Assembly was accomplished with basic tools (they are metric though) in about 4 hours with frequent extended breaks from a seated position. I am disabled but someone in good shape could have done it in an hour.My neighbor ( also disabled ) ,who has been riding a trike for years, took a spin on my new Meridian and now plans to get one for himself to replace his""other brand"" 20 inch fold up job.I thought that my 300+ pounds might be an issue.It has not been and even the seat seems to be up to the task.

I just got this futon and really like it! It's just me using it, and the good thing is that i can use it for sitting up and lying down. This is because it is in two sides, so one I can set up with a higher back and arm position to make it easier to sit on, and the other can have a lower back and arm position so I can use the arm as a pillow and get enough room for my arm so I can use my laptop lying down. A great value and fits excellently in my small living room :) The only reason it gets less than 5 stars for features is that the highest position on the back is uncomfortably straight for sitting, and the next position down is a little too laid back for me, but I can fix that with a couple of couch pillows.

This aquarium is beautiful when finished setting up ; and it was very easy to put together. Everything you need to get started .I have had no problems whatsoever with it since I began using it about a month ago. The fish seem to love it too !!! If new at aquariums, i suggest you follow the directions carefully and be sure to let the aquarium areate and wait 48 hrs before adding your fish for the first time. (Don't forget to add the ""AquaSafe"" to the water) ENJOY !!!!

I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas and she absolutely loved it. She got a real kick out of the sounds it makes when you place the pots that come with it on the ""burners"". (boiling water and sizzling sounds from the frying pan). There are drawers, cabinets, counter space and more. The only complaint that I have is that the microwave door is very hard to open and close. My daughter put it together. She said it wasn't too difficult but it did take her a good, couple of hours. All in all I was very pleased and feel I got my money's worth.

The product is well made and a very good size. The kitchen is perfect size both in height and in bulk. It does not take up too much space, but it has all the feature your child may want.I am not that handy, and I found assembly to be fairly easy in terms of understanding the instructions. Total assembly took me approx. 1.5 - 2 hours.

I bought this in Aug of 2011 for my sons b-day. He wanted a drum set. I dont know how to play and he has no idea either. But I thing the darn thing has great sound, figured it would be some cheap toy sound but it was not. Thought it was going to be tough and take a while to assemble cause I know nothing about drums or the terminology, just follow directions and pictures and it will take about 15min or so. I think this has great sound for the money. Keep in mind we know nothing about drums.

We have had this for a few days and we bought it to go with the HP Pavilion a6313w that we also purchased from Walmart.com. I love this monitor. I was affraid that it did not offer a tilt feature because I did not read this in the description, but to my surprise, you can tilt it! It is very nice and saves a lot of space on your desk. So far I am very happy with it!!! And Acer has a great 3 year warranty and once you register with them online, they offer you free software to download!!! Very nice!

I am a business traveler that spends alot of time in hotels and airports. The n810 is perfect for accessing all of my vendor websites. The fact I can access Gmail was a big plus. Best browser experience on an small device, in my opinion, even better than the iphone.One draw back is the somewhat expensive Nav software. At $130, I would expect better graphic maps, for an extra $50 my Mio C310x blows the doors off of the Wayfinder, but I bought it any way.How much do I like the n810? I posted this review using it :-)

We love to bed but when we put it togather, the holes for the screws weren't drilled correctly. It took forever to get it right and even now, I'm concerned that the screws might fall out.

Now in all honesty, I've never sat down to play a real game of D&D, but I thoroughly enjoy games based closely on the ruleset. Perhaps my positive thoughts on this game are a bit biased, between my love of D&D based games and my love of tactical RPGs.Dungeons and Dragons Tactics stays fairly close to the rules (almost annoyingly so at times) while seamlessly translating the classic pen and paper game into a robust and full-featured tactical RPG.

This machine does a great job on spot cleaning the carpet. We have a new dog who isn't quite house broken yet and for the occasional accidents, the Bissell is great for sucking up the liquid and for doing a good cleaning job. It does such a good cleaning job that the spot cleaned is cleaner looking that the rest of the carpet. I did have to get use to the fact that it squirts forward rather than down from the cleaning head.

This was a queen size mattress. It arrived rolled, in a box, dimensions 61"" x 19"" x 23"". This was too big for me to transport, which is why I had it delivered.I laid it on the bed base and cut the plastic wrapper. It unrolled flat. There was a strong odor (the kind of smell you find in furniture or carpet stores). I opened a window and switched on an extractor fan and the smell was mainly gone by bed time.I slept on it that night. I have now been sleeping on it for 2 weeks and find it very comfortable and it has relieved my lower back pain.It is not fully reversible, as advertized, as it is one sided.Overall, great bang for the buck.

This product was given as a gift from us to our granddaughter for her 7th birthday. That evening my daughter plugged the new Nintendo DS (that our granddaughter had also gotten for her birthday) into the docking station to get charged. The next morning when we went to take the DS out of the docking station, much to our dismay, we couldn't get it out. One side seemed to lift but the other was stuck! After much work and a complete dismantling of the docking station, we managed to get the DS out, but apparently the pins were bent and now even the charging unit that came with the DS would not go in. The DS had to be replaced. If that was not bad enough, after my granddaughter put her new DS into the case that came with the ""bundle"", the zipper refused to open. We finally got it open with a little force. This product seems to be inferior in a lot of ways and certainly not worth the money .

This wall mount is a great value compared to similar products. It is well made and very easy to install. The accompanying stud finder is an added bonus and along with the built in level, installation is quite easy. The wall mounting screws are large and will require a pre-drilled hole to secure to a 2x4. After mounting bracket to wall there is little doubt of any stability issues. Functionality of the wall mount is acceptable and would reccomend this product to friends.

I used this product for the first time this past Monday. I used it to power a nebulizer machine and it worked great. Plenty of continuous power to run the machine (which is pretty important when you need it to keep breathing!) It did the job and I had no problems at all with it. Since I have only used it the one time I will have to come back again if I have any difficulty with it in the future. (I usually use my machine at home. Only used it for the machine since it was an emergency situation, which is what I bought it for.) Just be sure whatever you want to use this with will work with the power specifications of this product. I took the machine into WalMart, but WalMart couldn't help me know if it would work or not for the machine. So make sure you know what you need to work with your equipment. My son is an electrician and so was able to tell me this would work for me since I have no knowledge in this area.

Just got this 42"" Vizio 3 weeks ago, moved into a new place and wanted a nice new addition to the living room...and this was the perfect fit. Picture quality is amazing! Sound quality is not TOO bad, some channels and some shows are quieter than others, but overall xbox 360 gameplay is unbelieveable and the HD channels are indescribable, for the price I don't think there is a better tv on the market, plenty of connections for other components, get the 2 year extended warranty provided by walmart just in case because vizios warranty is circumstantial and doesn't cover everything but walmart does, overall if you don't want to spend more than $1000 and want a fantastic tv, this is the one!

Glass backboard is great , very solid. Easy to assemble . Small parts are well packed and readily identified. In assembling the post, a little grease or oil at the mating parts, will enable one man to put them together easily while on the ground, one end butted against a tree, and the other end driven by a small sledge hammer.

To inflate this thing I purchased the Coleman electric quickpump ($20). My biggest concern was over inflating or how much is too much? The quickpump worked fine inflating the boat with a bit of air leakage at the end that takes a quick hand to minimize. I still can't attach the front stripping apron, I left it off. The advice on the keel mentioned in the above review is a good idea, hope I can figure out the best way to do it. You do not want to take this boat out in windy weather if you are planning a round trip. For messing around in a rockpit/lake/canal it works. For more serious adventures I would look around at other possibilities.

We've had this keyboard for 2 years and had no problems or complaints. It has worked with out a glitch on our HP Pavilion Media Center TV PC using both Windows XP Pro and also Vista (for the last 5 mos.).This may be Too Much Info, but it is still working well despite a baby squirrel we rescued relieving herself on it. Poor keyboard-deserved better after its faithful service to us. Shopping now to replace it with identical model - minus the p** odor and 'ick' factor.

My 8 year old is very pleased with this bike. It has everything he wanted hand/foot brakes & kickstand. Some parts on the bike seem a bit cheap, like the chain guard made of plastic, and cheap pedals. Also, the seat that came with the bike is pretty narrow and hard, so we ended up putting our son's comfortable seat from his old bike on it. We also had to put the pedals from his old bike on it, because one of the pedals that came with the bike just fell apart within the first 30 minutes of riding the bike. I called the number on the bike information packet, and they were very nice and sent replacement pedals though. On the positive side, the bike is good looking and rides well for the price.

I own a 50inch LCD tv with a HD DVD player. Thought this would be a great DVD for parties and such. Got it in the nick of time for our holiday party and was completely embarassed to even play it. The picture is gritty and very pixilated. This DVD does not even remotely appear to be HD quality. It's a shame, because the idea is fantastic. And having different kinds of 'tanks' to choose from was a good idea too.

Works as advertised. Cleans dog hair off my couch quickly. Powerful and does well on the stairs.Walmart's delivery was super... it was at my door the next day.The only drawback is cleaning dog hair off the filter... but not enough to really complain. I'm happy with the product. Better than the Dyson hand held for about $100 less.

I have young children and am also a daycare provider and all of the children (6 months- 10 years old) seem to really enjoy this swing set. We paid a friend to put it together and he didn't have much trouble at all. It was all together in a matter of hours.The swing set didn't come with an instruction manual on how to put it together. When I checked out the Walmart website it had the manual that you could download and print......50 pages later!!!! It also didn't come with the hanging bar that is suppose to be between the two swings. Not sure about that but didn't want to deal with the issue of getting one since we just hung an infant swing in its place. For the price of this swing set I can't really complain since other than those two minor issues its great!!!

My son who just turned 4 is learning how to ride his big boy bike now. Good thing he does have experience with a healmet since he was 2 which contributed to him being able to understand what the helmet does (protect his head). It is a little on the heavy side, but maybe that's because my son is a little on the smaller size. lol! Anyways, it does its job and looks cool too! My son loves Toy Story and loves not hurting his head! Thanks!

This chair was very difficult for one person to assemble. I know I still have one screw that would not go all the way in, but I am still able to sit in it and nap in it as it is. I bought this chair from Walmart.com because it was cheaper than the one I wanted from Pier One. However, with the assembly difficulties, if I had been more patient, I probably would have waited and ordered the wicker version from Pier One. BUT, being able to order it online and have it in a couple of days was a huge perk. Overall - I am pleased.

I have a small yard w/fairly thin grass and this mower does well on it. It's my first push mower and it feels good not to pay for maintenance or fuel. I even was able to take a phone call and the other person didn't even know I was mowing. I do have a small hill in the front that makes it just a bit challenging. Also even small sticks can create a slight interruption. I'm happy with it as a great push mower to start out with, good value and good product.

Great picture quality, easy setup, and sleek looks make this a winner in my book. While this TV doesn't have all the latest features (3D or built-in WiFi), it does do a great job in its niche. The only weak point is the sound quality. Weak and pretty tinny. But not an issue for me since I have a home theater audio setup. The price is right though. If the drawbacks mentioned aren't an issue for you, this set is a winner!!

This T.V. does everything you would expect and is surprisingly light weight with a brilliant display. It wall mounts easily and is a beautiful addition to any room with its glossy black finish. I have only had two issues with this T.V. and both are minor, one the sound options are relatively limited which is a little annoying when connecting it to an A/V Receiver, and two, the power cord is not very long which is annoying when wall mounting if you don't have an outlet in close proximity. Other then these I would Highly recommend this Device I have not been disappointed.

I have used Databank watches for a long time. Out of all the ones I have had, this is the first I have had with a medal band. The band maybe a little too big for me, but that can be fixed easy.The main reason(s) I got the one with the medal band is because the band broke on my black databank watch, and I have had the black one so long that the numbers and letters were rubbed off.

This camera has features that go well beyond expectations. The optics are excellent and the colors are brilliant and accurate. The panoramic feature is easy to use and really spectacular. With all these features the camera still can fit into a pocket so it will be right there when that unexpected opportunity for a picture pops up. I also like the fact that it uses standard batteries so I don't have to worry about taking the charger with me on trips. Although the operating life on regular batteries is quite good I generally use rechargeable lithium batteries. Either way this camera is not a power hog. I shouldn't say it but this camera is way under priced.

This lamp has a pink/orangish look when off and glows like embers in a fireplace when turned on. I have turned it on and never turned it off, so it's been on continuously since December 24th. I bought one for my 34 year old brother and he keeps his on 24/7 in his bedroom and loves it also. At first I noticed a slight ""salty"" smell ... like the smell of the ocean, but it's gone now. In fact, I ocassionally pick up a rock and smell it and there's nothing. I don't know about all the metaphysical things this lamp is supposed to provide, and I didn't purchase it for that. I love it!

The device is hard to learn to use because of very poor documentation. It's real hard to navigate one's way through the menu items. On the plus side, the sound is excellent, though I recommend pitching the ear-buds and using a better set of headphones. Don't buy for the voice recorder. One has to hold the microphone an inch or so from one's mouth to get any decent sound.

Love the picture quality. It's all I had hoped for in a 37"" TV. However, I've only had it for a month so I can't really comment on any long term issues. I got 15 years out of my last TV (a 32"" JVC) with no problems and if I get anywhere near that with the Sanyo I'll be pleased.

We bought this for our son's 1st birthday and he loves it! Everyday he either brings it to me for mommy-and-me time, or turns it on and plays quietly for 30 min or more. At first, it was always mommy-and-me because he couldn't turn it on, but now at 14 months, he can turn it on, press the green go button, and play by himself. Great for at home when mom is busy or in the car for self-entertaining!

The bag looks like a miniature doctors medical bag. It has plenty of room for any size GPS, windshield mount, 12V DC adapter, toothbrush, toothpaste and medium sized brush! The entire bottom 1"" is protected with a harder material which provides great protection versus soft nylon bags. You wouldn't want to drop the bag, but at least sharp corners won't break the GPS glass! There's also zippered pockets on each side providing more storage space! However, the bag is still small and compact enough to carry easily! Highly recommend this bag!

I bought this television to go in my daughters' bedroom. It fits inside their dresser/armoir nicely. The sound is a bit muffled at times, but that could be due to the fact that the television is inside a cabinet with double doors that open outward, so it's possible that the speakers are slightly covered. The picture is very clear and my daughters love the sleep timer feature on it. I would purchase another just like it for other bedrooms in our home.

I just finished reading my 'personally' autographed copy of Zero Regrets and I love it! Meeting him was magnetic even for the short 2 seconds it took him to sign my book and a picture. And 292 pages were not enough. I wanted to read more from this Olympic champion. I thought the 2010 Short Track competitions in Vancouver were riveting. This book takes you out on the ice with Apolo to relive it all over again from his own perspective. It was fantastic to read the play-by-play action. I have always been fascinated by this young man and I think we will see him involved in the Olympics for years to come. Whether he is competing on the ice or on the sidelines as a coach. He has a gift and a lot to offer. Even though I am not an athlete, I got a lot of inspiration from his writing. He shares a lot of himself in this book and I will carry his message in my heart and recall his shared experience to give me strength when I need it in the challenges of my life. I loved everything he shared; from his fathers history, his heritage and his struggles as a teenager. I think it's awesome that he has Samurai warrior blood running in his veins. He was born a winner. But his life could have gone in another direction altogether and we would have missed out on a wonderful opportunityto share in his US Olympic victories. I hope to read more about his mother. That may be another book altogether. There doesn't seem to be anything this young man cannot accomplish. I'm a big fan and I highly recommend this book. It's a good read.

I am going to tell you all the good first. The picture is awesome. It is really then and has an incredibly sleek design. Everything was very easy to hook up.Now the bad. It did not come with the internet connectivity. You have to buy an adapter which Best Buy will tell you is being discontinued so you better go get it quickly. I got mine for a pretty good price online, but I was slightly disappointed that I needed to purchase it. On the LG site, they tell you Netcast has Pandora. I still do not have that app on my Netcast and that was one I was looking forward to having since I already have an Apple TV for Netflix. Before I hooked it to my surround sound, I was not impressed with the sound coming from the tv.Overall, I am very satisfied with this tv for the price. I would buy it again if I were still looking.

I really like the ringtones that can be set with these my old one didn't have ringtones like this which make it even more great. The number keys are nice and big so i don't mess up dialing. The range is good. We have the base downstairs and the other two in the bedrooms. Nice and clear sounding too which is great my last phone didn't have great sound quality. Over all i recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new phone and don't want any signal disruption with the internet router.

Carlson gates are the only ones I found that have a small pet door within the main gate. We wanted to restrict a larger dog but allow a small (15 lb Shitzu) dog to be unrestricted. This gate works perfect for that.The only negative is I would prefer a self-latching mechanism rather than needing to manually un-latch and latch the gate to go through.If we need to move larger objects through the opening there are 4 mounting clips to release and the entire gate can be removed without tools.

Let me start by saying thay I am very picky. This was my 4th purchase and I've finally found a keeper. I have been searching for a camera that takes clear CRISP pictures and this one is by far the best!! The zoom will not disappoint you. I have played with it by taking indoor low light pics and am thirlled. I also love that I am able to zoom while taking video....something that is not standard on most cameras. The intelligent auto and easy modes make taking great pictures a breeze.I must admit that at first I wasn't thrilled with the idea of having a lens cap but it comes with a strap and is not an issue at all. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for great pictures without all of the fuss you have to go through with an SLR. This is a big step up from the average point and shoot compact camera. This camera is a lil bit bigger but soooo worth it!!

I looked at several wireless routers and the E3000 has the best specifications and reviews for the money.The set up was easy and quick, however I'm not sure I see any performance improvement over my old ""G"" Linksys router. I am in an area of fair to poor internet service (AT&T) and was hoping that this router would give me some improvement especially with streaming Netflix movies.We have seen a slight improvement with not dropping the movie streaming.If you ran both the old and new router side by side not sure you could tell which one your system was using!Over all I feel upgrading to the ""N"" router was a good move and it works. I have had it for three weeks and have NO problems with the router working!One last concern is the unit runs very warm. I do keep it elevated so the air can circulate under the bottom to help keep the temp down.

I just purchased this TV today. Noticed reviews about having to use two remotes if you have Direct TV, that is not so. Even though Direct TV does not list Polaroid as a brand of TV to program your remote, all you have to do is call them and they will give you another code. They gave us a code and they talked us through it no big deal and we only use one remote.

This product is buy far the worst alarm clock I have ever purchased. First after setting it up I noticed that the time display was not back-lit (like the picture on the Box) and the time could not be read at night! What an inconvenience at night or early dawn. Next I found out that you can not wake to the ipod another disappointment. The next thing is the FM radio reception was poor, I did get some stations but very poorly and this radio has a metal antenna. Not very happy! The last straw was that I had used it to wake me for work one day by way of the radio and it worked fine, the next day it woke me but I could not get it to turn off. I tried everything even call Emerson and they said its probably a short and to return it to the store. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS JUNK!!!

I wanted a small player for my trike and this was the right amount of MB but its so small, charges by USB only and does not hook up to aux other than to play will not show songs or let you advance with hand controls on the radio unit. Not advanced enough for my needs (NO Screen Either!)\Returned to store and bought a NANO.

My son bought this heli and it was a great toy to play with. Actually has spring loaded missiles that actually shoot. Great idea! Played with it for about 2 days before it broke, just like the rest of them we have bought in the past. It would run for about 5 seconds before losing power and fall to the ground. The good news is that if you are going to buy this heli, Walmart is the place to buy it from with their 90 day warranty available for free. The only problem is we lost our box, but had the receipt. Walmart said, no problem,we'll replace it. So here we go to try another one.

I use my sewing machine mainly for mending.The bobbin wind on my machine is no longer functional, and the cost of repair a bit steep for an old machine.A friend suggested the SideWinder; knowing that I would not need to use the bobbin winding frequently.My friend does sew a great deal. For herself, she purchased a higher priced, but more substantially made winder.I have used the SideWinder. It is simple to use and filled the bobbins quickly.Overall, I am pleased with the purchase.

I purchased this set to replace pieces that I broke from a previously-owned set. I love the 2 lidded, larger casseroles. I use mainly for single-recipe sides and also to steam vegetables in the microwave. Great look and they're oven/microwave/dishwasher safe and look good enough to serve from. My only complaint is that smallest round dish does not have a lid (have a previous set that contained same small dishes with plastic/storage lid) so I don't find the smallest dish particularly useful, but still consider the set a fair value even without a use for the smallest piece.

O.k., I am going to lay it down like it is with this product. I have been researching Flatscreen LCD's for about 4 months and decided to purchase the Visio. It is being advertised for $996.00 and I feel it is worth every Dollar. I have a degree in engineering and work in a technical industry so one could say I am at least moderately tech savy. I compared the Visio to 3 other TV's. The Sanyo (Walmart), Insignia (BB), Dynex (BB). They were all 1080P in the 42 in catagory for about the same amount of money. The Visio beat the Insignia and Dynex on all fronts. The Picture quality was noticeably better, Sound was noticeably better, and it had more features than these two. The one area that Best Buy has Walmart beat is in the extended warranty department. An additional 4 year warranty was offered for about $128.00 along with an Accidental damage warranty. I have used BB's warranties before and I like them. I did purchase the Walmart 2 year extended warranty for $58.00 not because I am worried that the TV will die on my but more for peace of mind. I don't know how user friendly it will be if I ever do need to use it. The Visio compared to the Sanyo was a very close comaprison. Pictures look very close as well as sound. I decided to go with the Visio because the visio had a slightly faster refresh rate at 5 ms instead of Sanyo's 8 ms. Also the Visio had more in-ports. The Visio had a higher contrast ratio at 5000:1 as well. For those 1st timers out there, with a LCD, color is important but not as important as it's Black and white contrast abilities. This is what gives you your definition.All in all I have owned the TV for a little more than a week and love it. It seems to be built well and looks like it is of good quality. Some of the other brands just look cheap. the Sound is terrific without a entertainment system. It handles standard definition very well. I upgraded to HD on Dish and will never go back.One important note to first time Flat Screen Buyers. The TV's in the store are basically mounted and turned on. The Visio has picture modes and it is preset to ""cool"" mode by default. If you are not aware of this when you are looking at them, it appears to have a slightly washed out effect on the picture (bluish tint). It is just a preset mode, I changed this to ""Normal"" picture mode and the colors were fantastic. Keep this in mind when comparing pictures in the store. TV's always have a default setting which is what they are all probably on.

The product was great. However, the packaging was horrible. The camera was just put in a box 3 times the size of the camera with no packaging at all. Since this was a gift which I had to mail 2000 miles away, I only hope it was not damaged. I really am shocked as I have never had a package from Walmart not properly wrapped.

I initially got this pillow to use during bi-weekly massage therapy appointments once I was no longer able to lie on my stomach. It works great for that because the little wedge cradles my belly and the back wedge helps me feel supported (and not like I'm going to fall off the massage table#. My therapist says it does not interfere with her work at all.I also took this on a multi-city trip which involved staying in hotels for 10 nights. I was 28 weeks and really starting to get big, but I still was waking up on my back #in pain and, of course, out of the recommended position). This pillow is not only compact enough to take it where you need to go, but it really keeps you from rolling over. I know one reviewer cited that as a ""con,"" but for me it was a ""pro."" It kept me on my left side. Occasionally, I would roll over, but since the pillows weren't really ideal for that, I would find my way back to the left. (FYI, I am a larger person [size XL] and it fits me fine.)Finally, the price is unbeatable. If you can only purchase one thing to help with sleeping, this is a great deal. I could also see using the wedges, which can be separated entirely via the Velcro, to get comfortable in chairs, or in the car, although I haven't tried that.

This product is good for the price. We used it on a road trip to the beach with our 4 and 6yr old children. There were more cords than I expected, but from what I can tell this is standard with headrest mounted DVDs. It was easy to install and use. The earbuds aren't that great for my kids....regular headphones that cover the ear would be better for them. The earbuds that came with the unit will be fine for older kids. We are happy with the product and considering we didn't spend a lot, I'm happy with it.

Similar to another reviewer I have a 4 mile commute with hills and my only objective was to get to work at least as fast as a normal bike without needing a shower when I got there.This bike meets all my requirements for less than a conversion kit for my existing bike.Will you go 18 mph? More like 15. Will you get 22 miles out of the battery? Maybe if you weigh 100 pounds (with work backpack I weigh nearly 250), ride perfectly flat terrain with no wind at half throttle until the bike simply won't move. Will you have to pedal? Yes. My bike came with a pedal sensor that will cut out the motor if you don't pedal for more than 20 to 30 seconds. The battery indicator is essentially useless. the frame is heavy and the components are low end, but they work.The drive system used to be sold as a kit from USPro Drive and is used on a bunch of scooters. There are lots of aftermarket replacement parts and upgrades available including a 1000W motor.In essence this is a great option to get a turnkey e-bike for short commutes while leaving your options open to upgrade in the future.

I've been having trouble getting this mill to work properly and was considering returning it to WalMart. I've tried adjusting the amount of pepper corns in the grinder as well as the coarseness level. After just now testing it and swearing to return it, it seems to be working better than ever. Until now the only way I could get it to work was to shake it while it was grinding. We'll see!

This vest rides a little high even when adjusted low. THe lack of padding on the shoulders is horrible on your collar bones. You have to give it 3-4 days after a good run before you can wear it again. The only solution is wearing a sweatshirt to have a buffer, which is fine when its cool, but not when it's 80+ degrees.

I purchased this unit on December 7th. This unit looked great in the store but once hooked up at home it had terrible motion blur-after reviewing all the literature on LCDs, it appears they all suffer from this, including top of the line units. The picture is not sharp in general regardless of the blur-my analog tv is much sharper. It is very distracting to have to watch motion blur. It's like watching a cartoon. I will be returning this unit, hopefully getting a plasma or my money back. I understand plasmas have no problem with motion blur.

This wallpaper border is very, very cute! However, the directions weren't detailed enough for me (I never did this before). The first strip we did was a mess, the water/glue was dripping down the wall and I was freaking out that it was ruining the paint. I frantically wiped it all up and luckily once the wall dried there wasn't any stains. I wouldn't soak it in the tub for 45 seconds like it says. I would just soak it to get it wet and then I wiped the back and front with a towel to get excess water off before putting it up. Once we got the hang of it, it was fine, but very frustrating at first! It ended up really cute though!

All the parts were there, all the holes lined up for assembly, and it's beautiful, actually looks like I could've spent well over what I paid for it. Enough storage/shelving space...especially for the avid gamer...fits 3 consoles plus the cable box and what have you!. OVERALL AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!!!

My wife purchased this for our 4 month old daughter. From day one, our daughter loved the music and sounds. She was barely able to touch her tip-toes to the ground. Now she is over 5 months old and is exploring every aspect of the toy. She can now touch almost flat-footed, and has learned to spin her seat. The concept of the seat rotating around the table is perfect. The toy can be used as a stand-alone play table once she grows out of the seat. I recommend this to everyone!

Love this little thing. When I first took it out of the box, it looked like one of the kids toys, so little, I thought there was no way it was gonna tackle the mess in this house, as I have four kids, a dog and a husband. This little thing is AWESOME!!! it does a better job than my other upright. It had the same amps as my other one, but smaller and fit in smaller spaces better, under chairs and desks. Only two settings, carpet and hard floors, but worked great. I have a thick carpet and a thin carpet, it moved with ease from one to the other, and cleaned beautifully. And if it breaks, buy it again, its cheap enough. Like the bagless too, my first one. Very easy.

I ordered these Theater 3D glasses to use with my new Vizio 3D TV. The glasses work perfectly and are either identical to, or very similar to, the glasses which came with the TV.

This product is just what we needed, a sturdy printer table with storage. It takes a while to assemble though. Some parts are labeled well, some not at all. And the directions leave out some very important directions (it matters on which end of the leg you put the foot). I was a little concerned that it seemed shaky, but once it was completed, it's very sturdy. I would've given 5 stars if the instructions were totally clear.

I thought this phone was a great value. I had a slider phone previously and loved it. This phone is great too and works perfectly. One of the reasons I bought this phone was because my old cell phone company kept gouging me month after month for services I was not using.

After filling the unit with water and waiting for it to come to temp was not long at all. And it does what it's suppose to do. I was very satisfied with the results it did on my kitchen and bathroom floor tiles. Can't say much about the durability because it's only been a few weeks. But so far I am completly statisfied with this Bissell floor cleaner!

I bought this TV in Feb. 08'. I would say that the picture is good quality and the built-in DVD is convieient. The size is slim, so it fits small stands.What was disapponiting was that the speakers sometimes crackle, especially when the volume is turned up, at the end of a sentence when the syllable is loud. There is also a big difference in the volume between 3 and 4. (3 is a little to quiet and 4 you can hear clearly upstairs.) The control menu has really tiny print. I have to sit right up next to the TV to see it and I have good eyesight. The different sound and picture settings aren't that good. The widescreen picture setting warps/streches faces on non-HD channels. While the 'normal' setting leaves black vertical spaces down the side. If the channel comes in HD (I have 2) then the picture is fine and full-screen. I guess if you have all HD channels this wouldn't be an issue.

We bought this car seat a few weeks before our daughter turned 1 in October and we are still in love with it. It is a little difficult to get it level in the rear facing. A leveler on the side would have made it easier to get it level. The print is very cute and girlie, which I love. What little girl wouldn't want to ride like a princess in her pink car seat?!? The cover takes a little time to get off if it needs to be cleaned. It is worth the time since I know it isn't just going to slide off. I haven't had a lot of trouble with the straps, just minor things like it getting tangled a little, that could still happen with any carseat. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles, that is why I like it, it's simple.

I had to call customer service more than once.I had no idea this elliptical would take up half of my diningroom. Its HUGE, and taller than I am (I'm 5'7"")I have to re-tighten the screws before using it because it will squeek if I dont.You will have to disassemble it to move it to another room.

My second Sonic Care, first one lasted me 10 years. Yes, this is an extremely expensive toothbrush but the crud that it pulls of of your teeth and gums will shock you. Word of caution, the vibrations can be hard to get used to. Your mouth will tingle and you will feel a ticklish sensation that may be difficult to get used to but it is worth it!I got way, way behind on dental visits some years ago and was forced to endure an extreme cleaning schedule that was supposed to last four visits like a week apart. I swear they used a laser and a fire hose. Bought my first Sonic Care after the first session and it performed so well that the dentist cancelled my last two extreme cleanings. WORTH IT!

I use this almost daily on our hardwood/tile floors. It's light and easy to move around, and the cord is super-long so you don't have to stop and move it. It transitions flawlessly from the hard floors to the area rugs, and makes the rugs look brand new again after each vacuuming - even with our large black lab! Great value for the money, and the portable attachment vac is nice too.

As stated in another review just make sure you have 16"" on center studs to attach to.

This receiver does everything I expected it to do. Used this to replace my Sony (even though it doesn't have all of the DSP modes) it does allow you to adjust individual speakers levels better than Sony.Don't see how you go wrong by buying this receiver for the average audio listener. Works great with Satellite HD and DVD. Gives that added dimension you don't have with TV audio. May want to add JVC 5.1 surround sound speakers SXXSX600 to complete the system.

Computers are difficult to buy. Substitutions of lower quality parts can be made can be made in many areas of a system. Almost no one has the expertise to tell you where this really makes a difference.Ok to begin with the computer has an AMD X3 central processing core with three central processing units. This is unusual. It turns out these chips are essentially defective X4 quad core units, where one of the processors didn't work and is disconnected. Some people claim (I'm sure AMD does) that the fourth core in a quad core is almost never used anyway and that a tri-core ought to outperform an Intel dual core or an AMD X2. Maybe this is true but who knows.I went to the Dell site and tried to reproduce the system to see what Dell would charge me directly. It turns out the X3 distributed with this unit (the 8450) isn't used by Dell. They use a slightly faster 8650. I don't think this is a big deal especially. The difference in price between the units (from AMD) is only $20.Everything else I could get (memory, monitor, speakers, etc.) from Dell. So buying this unit from Walmart, minus the cost of the better processor, saves you about $160. Dell does throw in a few extras (online storage) but the Walmart price is still a deal.Unfortunately, in the past week I have been having problems with the system I have. Dell includes VGA and DVI cables to connect the monitor to the system. However the PC has only VGA and HDMI connectors. I bought an HDMI cable to connect the monitor (the monitor has an HDMI slot). However the display shrinks to about 80% of the size of the monitor when the HDMI cable is used. Further the HDMI hookup sometimes produces nothing but a black screen. The VGA connection works all right but the display quality is not as good as with the HDMI cable.Also the sound system only works occasionally. Sometimes the speakers work and sometimes they don't. Sometimes the headphones can be used and sometimes they don't work. I am waiting now for a Dell technician to arrive (in the next 10 min) to replace the ""mother board"" for the the third time in five days.
